      When a form submission fails (validation error, server error), the
      user's entered data should be preserved so they don't have to re-type
      everything. Baymard found 34% of sites don't retain credit card data
      after a validation error.

        Users should never have to re-enter information they already provided,
        especially sensitive data like payment details or long form fields.

      Error states should use colour AND an icon AND text to communicate
      the error — not colour alone. This is an accessibility requirement
