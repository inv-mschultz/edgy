      This destructive action (delete, remove, clear) has no visible
      confirmation step. Users might accidentally trigger it and lose data.

        Add a confirmation dialog before this destructive action. Use an
        Alert Dialog with a clear description of what will happen and a
        prominent cancel option.

      After completing a destructive action, providing an undo option
      (like a toast with an undo button) adds a safety net.

        Consider adding an undo toast after destructive actions complete,
        giving users a brief window to reverse the action.
      components:

  - id: vague-confirmation-label
    name: Destructive confirmation uses vague button labels
    severity: warning
    annotation_target: element
    description: >
      Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions should use specific
      button labels like "Delete Account" or "Remove Item" — not generic
      labels like "Confirm", "OK", or "Yes". WCAG and NNG both recommend
      unambiguous labels that state exactly what will happen.
    triggers:
      layer_name_patterns:
        - "(?i)(confirm|are.?you.?sure|delete.?dialog|remove.?dialog)"
      component_names:
        - AlertDialog
        - Alert Dialog
        - Dialog
    expects:
      in_screen:
        - layer_name_patterns: ["(?i)(delete.+button|remove.+button|cancel.+subscription|specific.?label)"]
    recommendation:
      message: >
        Use specific button labels in confirmation dialogs — "Delete Account"
        not "Confirm", "Remove Item" not "OK". The label should clearly state
        the destructive consequence so users know exactly what they're agreeing to.
      components:
        - shadcn_id: button
          variant: destructive
          label: "Specific Action Button"
        - shadcn_id: alert-dialog
          label: "Confirmation Dialog"

  - id: unsaved-changes-guard
    name: No unsaved changes warning on navigation
    severity: warning
    annotation_target: screen
    description: >
      Forms and editors with unsaved changes should warn users before
      they navigate away or close the tab. Accidentally losing a long
      form entry or document edits is one of the most frustrating user
      experiences.
    triggers:
      pattern_types:
        - form
      layer_name_patterns:
        - "(?i)(edit|form|compose|draft|editor|create|write|configure)"

      in_flow:
        - layer_name_patterns: ["(?i)(unsaved.?changes|discard.?changes|leave.?without.?saving)"]
    recommendation:
      message: >
        Add an unsaved changes guard — when users try to navigate away from
        a form with unsaved edits, show a confirmation dialog asking if they
        want to save, discard, or cancel navigation.
      components:
        - shadcn_id: alert-dialog
          label: "Unsaved Changes Dialog"
        - shadcn_id: button
          label: "Save Changes Button"

          variant: outline
          label: "Discard Button"

    name: Irreversible submission has no review step
    severity: critical
    annotation_target: screen
    description: >
      Submissions with legal, financial, or data-commitment consequences
      should include a review/summary step before final submission (WCAG
      3.3.4 / 3.3.6). This lets users verify all information before
      committing to an action that cannot be undone.
    triggers:
      layer_name_patterns:

      in_flow:
        - layer_name_patterns: ["(?i)(review.?step|order.?summary|confirmation.?page|preview)"]
    recommendation:
      message: >
        Add a review/summary step before this irreversible submission. Per WCAG
        3.3.4, submissions that cause legal or financial commitments must be
        reversible, checked for errors, or confirmed via a review step.
