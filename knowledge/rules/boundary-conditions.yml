    severity: info
    description: >
      Numeric displays like notification badges, counters, or pagination
      should handle zero, very large numbers (99+), and negative values.
    triggers:

    recommendation:
      message: >
        Show how this counter behaves at its boundaries: zero items,
        maximum display value (e.g., 99+), and potentially negative numbers.
      components:

          label: "Overflow Badge (99+)"

      Pagination controls should handle the first page (no previous button)

        Show pagination at its boundaries — first page with disabled
