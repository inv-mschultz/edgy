rules:
  - trigger:
      flow_type: onboarding
    findings:
      - id: nng_skip_onboarding
        severity: warning
        condition: "onboarding has no skip option"
        title: "Onboarding must have a skip option"
        evidence: "NNG: 'Always provide a way to skip onboarding. Returning users who re-install, or power users, will be frustrated by mandatory tutorials they don't need.'"
        recommendation: "Add a prominent 'Skip' or 'Maybe later' option on every onboarding step."

      - id: nng_contextual_over_upfront
        severity: info
        condition: "all onboarding happens upfront in a separate flow"
        title: "Prefer contextual help over upfront tutorials"
        evidence: "NNG: 'Contextual onboarding (tooltips, coach marks at the moment of need) outperforms upfront tutorials. Users learn better when guidance appears in context.'"
        recommendation: "Consider replacing some upfront onboarding steps with contextual tooltips that appear when users first encounter features."

      - id: nng_onboarding_progress
        severity: warning
        condition: "multi-step onboarding has no progress indicator"
        title: "Onboarding needs progress indicator"
        evidence: "NNG: 'Users need to know how many steps remain. Without a progress indicator, multi-step onboarding feels endless and increases drop-off.'"
        recommendation: "Add dots, a step counter (e.g., '2 of 5'), or a progress bar to every onboarding step."
