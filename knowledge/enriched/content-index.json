This article provides guidance for designing empty-state dialogues for content-less containers. At times, users will encounter empty states within an application: containers, screens, or panels for which content does not yet exist or otherwise cannot be displayed. Especially in complex applications that have not been fully configured by the user, empty states are quite common during onboarding and initial usage. Some typical scenarios when users might encounter empty states within an application are: When a user has not designated any items as favorites or has not opened any files yet, containers meant to display lists of favorited or recently viewed items will be empty. When an application supports alerts , but a user has not yet configured any alerts, there may be an empty pane or dialogue where those alerts will eventually appear. When an application is composed of various workspaces or dashboards , but a user has not added content to those areas, those pages or screens will be empty. Search results lists when nothing is found , as well as other cases where a command creates empty output. The default of an empty space is to simply remain empty: Display no content to the user until the space has been configured or personalized. While this approach may save development time (or even be an intentional decision during an early beta design of a product where other features must be initially prioritized), it ultimately creates confusion and decreases user confidence — and misses a goldmine of opportunities for increasing the usability and the learnability of the application, as well as the discoverability of key features. Empty states that are intentionally designed — not left as an afterthought — can be used to: Communicate system status to the user Help users discover unused features and increase learnability of the application Provide direct pathways for getting started with key tasks In This Article: Use Empty States to Communicate System Status Use Empty States to Provide Learning Cues Use Empty States to Provide Direct Pathways for Key Tasks Conclusion Use Empty States to Communicate System Status Totally empty states cause confusion about how and whether the system is working. When users encounter an empty panel or screen in an interface after attempting to filter, query or display specific content, they’re likely left wondering a myriad of questions: Is the system finished processing the request? Is content still loading? Did an error occur? Did I set the wrong filters or parameters? As an example, consider the dialogue for displaying log details below. When a user specifies and applies a date range for which there are no logs, the table in the dialogue — logically — does not display any log details. However, because there is no system feedback provided, the user cannot know whether there truly are no details to display, whether an error has occurred, or whether the system is still processing the request. Users are likely to waste time refreshing the query several times before feeling confident enough to move on. This dialogue lacks appropriate feedback: It is unclear whether there are no details to display in the table or the system is still working on gathering and displaying the details. A brief system message within the content area at completion of the process (e.g., “There are no records to display for the selected date range”) would be a simple yet effective way to increase the visibility of system status and, therefore, user confidence in the results. A simple message (There are no records to display for the selected date range) communicates the state of the system and increases user confidence. A worse, yet equally common scenario, especially in applications with high information density and lengthy processing times, is when the system defaults to a misleading system-status message: declaring that there are no items to display, only to replace it with content after the process is completed. For example, when loading content in the employee-management software below, users encounter an empty-state container with the system-status message No records . This information would be highly useful if, in fact, there were no records. However, after a few seconds of waiting, the system replaces the inaccurate system-status message with the requested items. Upon entering a new screen, users initially encounter an inaccurate system-status message No records (left). After several seconds, as the system finishes loading content, the message is replaced with a list of relevant items (right). Inaccurate system-status messages for empty states are particularly harmful. In the best-case scenario, users wait out the process and discover the relevant content but develop a severe distrust of and distaste for the application. In the worst-case scenario, trigger-happy users (that is, most users) never see the relevant content and cannot complete their work. Use Empty States to Provide Learning Cues In-context learning cues displayed when the user has started a task help users understand how to use an application or system in real time, as they explore the system. In most cases, this approach is generally more successful than forced tutorials shown to the user at initial use. That’s because in-context help can often be applied right away and is thus more memorable — users have little time to establish associations between lengthy onboarding content and the actual interface. Empty states present an opportunity to provide contextual help relevant to the user’s task. These help messages are sometimes called pull revelations because they show up only when the user interacts with the corresponding UI element and they are not “pushed” in any obtrusive or interruptive way. For example, consider the Alerts panel below from an enterprise resource-planning (ERP) application. When the Alerts panel is populated with alerts, it is fairly obvious how one might engage with the content. (This state of the panel is probably how this element was mocked up and tested.) However, when the Alerts panel is empty, it presents the issues previously discussed: Users may wonder whether an error has occurred or whether they have accurately created parameters necessary to trigger alerts. (As in the earlier example, a brief system-status message stating that there are no alerts would be useful here.) Furthermore, though, this totally empty state of the Alerts panel misses an opportunity to educate the user about the alerts function. A brief dialogue could provide information about what alerts are and how to get started using them. When there are active alerts (left), it is easy enough to understand how to dismiss and view details for alerts. When no alerts exist or have been created (right), the panel reverts to a totally empty state, missing an opportunity to provide contextual help to the user. In contrast, DataDog, a data-monitoring application, makes use of contextual help content within the empty state. When the user has not starred any items to create a list of favorites, the would-be content area displays the message Star your favorites to list them here . DataDog: When the users have not selected any favorites, the message Star your favorites to list them here , shown in the empty-state container, teaches users about the favoriting functionality and explains how the empty area could be used. In a similar example, when no items have been recently viewed in Microsoft Power BI, the empty-state screen contains a brief system message describing how content is added there. Microsoft Power BI: The empty-state container for inexistent recent items explains how content gets added to this area. Use Empty States to Provide Direct Pathways for Key Tasks In addition to alerting users of system status and increasing system learnability with pull revelations, empty states can also be used to provide direct pathways for getting users started with key tasks or completing steps related to their current workflow. For example, in one application-development software, the following system-status message No Records; Send a request to view details in the workspace was encountered in an empty state when no records were able to be displayed during a task. While this message does provide contextual information about what the user could do to view these records (i.e., it says to Send a request to view details in the workspace ), it doesn’t tell the user how to accomplish that task, or where to go in the system to find the necessary functionality. This system-status message within an empty state provides contextual help about what the user could do to view records, but it doesn’t tell the user how to accomplish the task. A better approach is to provide brief yet explicit instructions or, better yet, link directly to the steps that need to be taken to complete tasks associated with populating the empty state. (Here, the text Send a request might directly link to a message center or launch a message dialogue.) For example, the application below provides a direct link within the empty state — a button labeled Create which allows users to create alerts. For users who may need more information to understand why alerts are useful and how to use them, a Learn more link item also leads directly to associated documentation. The empty-state alerts panel links to additional relevant documentation and provides a button to begin creating alerts from directly within the empty state. This type of empty-state design has useful implications for users getting started with complex application features, as well. For example, when users have yet to add log data to their accounts within Loggly, a cloud-based log-management application, the empty state contains 2 direct pathways into the workflow: adding external log sources or populating demo data into the application to use for safe exploration. Loggly: An empty-state screen provides 2 direct pathways for getting started: adding log sources or exploring with demo data. Conclusion Don’t let empty-state design be an afterthought within your application. Intentionally designed empty states can help increase user confidence, improve system learnability, and help users get started with key tasks. To summarize a few main points: Do not default to totally empty states. This approach creates confusion for users, who may be left wondering if the system is still loading information or if errors have occurred. When content does not yet exist for a screen, page, or panel, use the empty state to provide help cues. Tell the user what could be displayed, and how to populate the area with that content. Provide direct pathways (i.e., links) to getting started with key tasks related to populating the empty state. When a process is running, use progress indicators to increase visibility of system status. If there is no relevant data to display after a process has completed, use the empty space to provide a system-status message in the empty space that briefly states that no content is available.

They are most commonly seen the first time a user interacts with a product or page, but can be used when data has been deleted or is unavailable. Overview Anatomy Designing with empty states Types of empty states In-depth alternatives Accessibility Related References Feedback Overview Empty states are a simple yet extremely powerful way to keep a user informed, supported, and on a productive path. They provide opportunities to communicate what the user would see if they had data, while providing constructive guidance about next steps. With just enough contextual guidance, empty states ensure a smoothness of experience, especially when things aren’t working as expected. Most people are familiar with the basic empty state page that explains what data would normally appear on a page. However, it’s not always a one size fits all. This pattern explores the following approaches: Basic empty states for first use, user action confirmation, and error management In-depth supplements and alternatives for first use empty states, including in-line documentation, onboarding, and starter content Anatomy Basic empty state with primary action button Image (optional): A non-interactive image that relates to the situation (optional). Title: A short and concise explanation. Where possible, write this as a positive statement. In this example, “Start by adding data assets” feels more positive than “You don’t have any data assets.” Alternatively, you could say “You don’t have any data assets yet”. Body: Explain clearly the next action to populate the space. You may also explain why the space is empty and include the benefit of taking this step. There are three options for explaining the primary action: Direct the user to a primary action button positioned underneath the copy Include a primary action link in the copy Direct the user to the UI element—see the example below. This has the benefit of teaching the user where elements are and how they will perform tasks in the future. Primary action—button or link in copy (optional): The primary call to action referenced in the body copy above. Secondary call to action (optional): If there is a secondary action, such as referencing documentation for further reading, include it as a link below the copy. Basic empty state with instruction to click UI element Designing with empty states Empty states are often treated as an afterthought. When designed thoughtfully, they become an essential part of a smooth user experience, providing just enough information, in context, to allow users to continue working in a productive way. During the design process, ask yourself these questions: What will the pages, tiles, data tables, and side panels look like without content? What are all of the steps a user can take to address the situation? Is there any useful content that might be available to show? How can I turn this situation into something that is engaging and helpful? During the design phase, explore the full range of options with your team to ensure that the most appropriate and helpful content is created for each empty space. When to use Empty states happen for a variety of reasons, and can require different treatments. Strive for a balance between the situation and the content you’re providing. More content doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better solution as there is a cognitive cost for having more content on the page. This is especially true when users first engage with your product, so save the more involved educational moments for primary features and more complex situations. The following table suggests different approaches for empty states to match the needs of the user in different situations. Basic empty states Type Use cases Goal of the empty state When to use No data empty states First time use, no data yet User understands what will be available on the page when data has been added or is available. They understand how to add data themselves. For simpler situations, or for secondary features where bite-sized pieces of information are preferable. User action empty states Provides feedback based on some user action. For example: No results when searching Confirmation of completion of a process User understands how to adjust search terms or filters to continue their search. User understands that they’ve successfully completed a process. User understands that they’ve successfully completed a process. When you need to provide feedback to the user based on an interaction. Error management empty states Permissions issue Systems issue Configuration required User understands the problem and if there are corrective actions available, knows what action to take or has options to correct the issue. When something is amiss or some level of intervention or troubleshooting is required, a higher level of detail and specificity will better support the user. Where to use Empty states always appear in the otherwise empty space, in the context of the data that’s missing. They can occur anywhere your app can display data, including but not limited to dashboards, data tables, tiles, full pages, and side panels. The approach and layout you choose will depend on the situation, and what is the most appropriate based on the page layout and context. Visual guidelines for smaller empty spaces For small tiles and side panels, follow these guidelines and use the layouts shown below. Alignment of elements Empty state elements should be left-aligned as a block. The one exception to this rule is an empty state in a small tile. In this case the image should be centered above the left-aligned text and primary action, as shown in the example below. This exception was made to prevent the empty state looking too much like content, where it could be skipped over. The centered image in a smaller space helps to draw attention to a state that may require user action. Image choice considerations The image choice should relate to the situation. The size of the space for the empty state should also guide the size of image. If space is limited, use just text. Multiple empty states In situations where there could be multiple empty states showing at once, we recommend using a tertiary button for the call to action. This avoids scenarios with multiple primary action buttons in the UI. Layout for empty state in a small tile Layout for empty state in a side panel Visual guidelines for larger empty spaces For larger spaces, you have some flexibility with laying out the larger empty states. Follow these guidelines, review the examples, and use your judgment as to what is best for the situation. Alignment of elements Empty state elements should be left-aligned as a block. Depending on the image you’re using, there are different arrangements available. Layout/positioning options You have two options for positioning the block in the larger empty states: Use a wider left margin Block center the left-aligned group in the empty space Image position options You have two options for positioning the image in the larger empty states: Above the empty state title—generally better for wider images To the left of the element block—generally better for taller images Image choice considerations The image choice should relate to the situation. The size of the space for the empty state should also guide the size of image. If space is limited, use just text. Layout options for empty states in large tiles—wide margin or centered block Layout options for empty states in tables—wide margin or centered block Layout options for full page empty states—wide margin and centered block Best practices Empty states should replace the element that would ordinarily show . For example, an empty state for a table would replace the table and the column headers and footer should not be present. This practice avoids having a screen reader read the entire table before getting to the message that there is no content in the table. Likewise, if you search for something and there are no results, any underlying content should be replaced by the empty state message. Consider how many empty states may appear in a space . If you have a dashboard with a number of widgets and there is a failure for multiple widgets to load, the repetition of the empty state may not have the same impact if you use illustrative icons. In this case, an empty state that uses just text may be preferable. Types of empty states No data empty states These are the most recognizable first use empty states, explaining what will be in the space once it is populated with data, and providing guidance for the next step the user can take to populate the space. Basic empty state with primary action button Basic empty state with instruction to click UI element Do: Use basic empty states for simpler situations, or secondary features, where bite-sized pieces of information are preferable. Be specific about what will be available in the space when data is there. Keep words to a minimum so they are fast to read and act upon. If there is an actionable next step, include a direct link in your message copy or a primary action button to make that action fast. Alternatively, guide them to what they need to click. Don’t: Don’t cover multiple options in one empty state. If there are multiple things a user can do, pick the most important and keep the focus on that action. Don’t use product-specific terms that the user may not yet understand. Don’t include content that is about other areas of the app. Be contextual. As a general rule, don’t lead the user into a dead end. If there are useful next steps, include them. User action empty states These empty states occur as a result of a user action. For example: A message showing there are no search results A success confirmation for completion of a process or set of tasks Explain the reason for seeing the message and providing any follow up steps to guide the user. For example, if there are no search results suggest adjusting the search or filters. Links to documentation may also be appropriate as a secondary call to action. A message showing there are no search results There may be situations where next steps are not possible or supplementary text is not required, so use your judgment about what is useful to include. For example, if your user has configured alerts and nothing has been triggered, it’s not a case of alerts not being set up but that there is nothing that requires the user’s attention. In this case, supplementary text is not necessary. Basic empty state where next steps are not required Error management empty states Empty states can also occur when there is data but it cannot be surfaced for some reason. A higher level of specificity is helpful here, with the aim that the user will be able to address the issue comfortably themselves. Provide guidance about why there is no data, and either what the user can do to address the lack of data, or the circumstances under which the data would appear. And use plain language. Following this fulfills Jakob Nielsen’s ninth usability heuristic: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors . Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, Jakob Nielsen Here are some error management situations that may be addressed with the basic empty state solution. Error type Explain why there is no data Explain what the user can do Permissions issue The user does not have permission to view the data. Suggest steps or process to request access. Systems issue Problems with a related system are preventing the data from being supplied. Explain steps the user can take to learn what has happened. For example, viewing an activity log. Configuration required Further configuration may be needed to access the data. Provide an explanation and the first step for the user to take for the required configuration. Action not supported For example, the user attempts to upload an unsupported file type. Explain what file types are supported. Example of an error management empty state for a systems issue Do: Consult with your team to explore what information is available. If there are corrective actions, give the user an actionable next step. Include a direct link in your message copy or a primary action button to make the next action fast. Alternatively, guide them to the element they need to click. Use direct, plain language to describe the situation. Be respectful of the user and don’t joke or use flippant language. Any images used should reflect the situation and be sensitive to what could be a serious situation. Don’t: Don’t include content that is about other areas of the app. Be contextual. Don’t lead the user into a dead end. Always aim to provide a path to a solution. If there are multiple things for the user to try, be sure to include a hierarchy so that it’s clear which option would be the primary action. For more detailed information about writing error messages, see the Nielsen Norman group’s Error Message Guidelines . A pattern providing guidance for error states is currently being planned. If you would like to contribute, please see our guidelines for contributions . In-depth alternatives Educational content that helps users get oriented and started is another option for turning an otherwise empty space into a positive and productive experience for first time users. When deciding on approaches, a good rule of thumb is that a primary resource on a page could benefit from a more educational approach, while basic empty states may suffice for secondary resources. Alternative approaches Type Use cases Goal of the empty state When to use In-line documentation First time use (of app or feature) Cleared or deleted data Configuration required Detailed overview of page so the user understands more about the feature and is given at least one call to action to get started. When introducing a primary feature, there is an opportunity to showcase the benefit of usage. More educational detail could help to drive engagement. Onboarding First time use Starting from an empty state, users have an opportunity to launch a contextual onboarding flow to gain deeper understanding about that area of the app. When introducing a primary feature that may require more detailed explanation of concepts, a step-through of a workflow sequence, or other information that enhances productivity. Usually onboarding flows are optional for users, therefore they need to be used in conjunction with basic empty states. Starter content First time use User can interact with data and learn the system by tinkering. User gets a jump-start to productivity with basic setup tasks being taken care of for them. For complex situations, starter content can be a good choice as it saves users a lot of time both in learning and in configuring setups. In-line documentation In-line documentation is an extension of the basic empty state for first time use. It can be most helpful when a primary feature is first introduced, providing more detail and highlighting any benefits. Including an image of the space populated with data may help trigger interest and usage. Following a progressive disclosure model, it could provide links out to more detailed documentation. Considerations for in-line documentation If testing results show that users do not understand the feature or concept, more detail may encourage usage. This approach may require a higher level of maintenance than a basic empty state if using product images as images will need to be kept up to date. If your app is translated, there could be extra work in providing localized images. Keep the content limited to one feature. Do not talk about other areas of the app. If there are multiple things a user could do, pick the most important and keep the focus on that. Onboarding Onboarding services provide various options for contextual in-app guidance that can enhance or direct a user through an empty state. Stepping users through workflows with information that supplements the empty state messages can get the user to a place of comfort quickly. Tours can point out the location of features, provide more detail for key tasks, and highlight benefits. Because onboarding flows are optional for users, they need to be used in conjunction with basic empty states. Considerations for onboarding If metrics are showing that users are not attempting to use a feature, even with an empty state, you may need supplementary information. An empty state can be used as a launching point for an onboarding sequence, to help users get through a process. When using an onboarding third party service, metrics can be viewed at any time, and adjustments to content can be made and deployed immediately. Usually onboarding flows are optional for users, therefore they need to be used in conjunction with basic empty states. Another aspect to consider is maintenance and the level of commitment required to maintain it. A pattern providing guidance for onboarding is currently being planned. It will include a framework for matching user needs with design solutions, tips for writing copy, and general best practices. If you would like to contribute, please see our guidelines for contributions . Starter content Another strategy for addressing an otherwise empty space is to provide pre-built content that allows new users to get started with an app quickly and without any concern. Pre-built content for apps Starter content can provide the opportunity for users to dive in and learn about primary features and functions with sample data. Users can tinker, examining and deleting content without serious consequences. If it’s possible to include some personalization here, that adds to the positive experience. Creating a chatbot is easy when you have a starting place with pre-built content. When someone feels like she can explore an interface and not suffer dire consequences, she’s likely to learn more—and feel more positive about it—than someone who doesn’t explore. Good software allows people to try something unfamiliar, back out, and try something else, all without stress. -Jenifer Tidwell, Designing Interfaces, (O’Reilly Media, 2011), 9. Pre-configured kits and workflows Other options for starter content are pre-configured kits and workflows. Pre-configured kits containing code and API credentials can offer a fast path to getting started. Starter content can also take the form of pre-configured workflows, where the configuration of services is automated, saving users from the tedium of a long setup process. Considerations for starter content Requires upfront planning with the full product team to determine workflow pre-configurations that would most benefit users. If your starter content can be deleted by your user, you will need a basic empty state as a back up. Accessibility As most empty state illustrations are considered decorative, they should be skipped by screen readers. A decorative image is one that does not serve any practical or informational purpose, and is included to fill a visual void. Do not include any informational content in your decorative image. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines require that decorative images are given either an empty alt Copy to clipboard tag or their role Copy to clipboard is assigned presentation Copy to clipboard . As an empty alt Copy to clipboard tag is more widely supported, we recommend you align with the WCAG guidance and avoid assigning role Copy to clipboard to presentation Copy to clipboard until support is more ubiquitous.

This progress indicator is used for full page loads and reduces the perception of a long loading time by providing clues for how the page will ultimately look. A skeleton screen is a design pattern used to indicate that a page is loading while providing users with a wireframe -like visual that mimics the layout of the page. This specific type of progress indicator is used exclusively for full-page loads. LinkedIn uses a skeleton screen to indicate that the page is loading and to give users a sense of how the page will be structured. In This Article: What Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens? Static-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens Animated Skeleton Screens Frame-Display Skeleton Screens Benefits of Using Skeleton Screens Are Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners? Conclusion References What Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens? There are 3 main types of skeleton screens: Static-content and -image skeleton screens Animated skeleton screens Frame-display skeleton screens Static-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens These are the most common skeleton screens and look like wireframes, in which the light gray boxes represent content and images. The structure of the gray boxes mimics the structure of the final page with content. The skeleton screen helps users build a mental model of what will be on the page and even gives some clues as to the underlying information hierarchy. Headspace uses a skeleton screen to build users’ expectations for the structure of the page. This skeleton screen relies on design conventions, with large gray boxes representing images and long rectangle boxes representing text. The thickest gray line at the top (1) implies a page title, with a smaller secondary line underneath that would be descriptive text (2); below that, the page is structured into a sequence map (3) with a card at each step. In each card there will be a title (4), a bit of accompanying text (5), and an image (6). On the right you can see what the fully loaded page actually looks like. Animated Skeleton Screens Some skeleton screens include animations in the form of a pulsating movement, with the use of gradients or elements fading in and out. These are similar to wait animations (or spinners) and signify that the system is still working and still loading content, decreasing users’ perception of a long loading time by keeping users engaged on the content being loaded. Note that animations of this sort can potentially be distracting , annoying, or even create accessibility problems for some users. DoorDash uses a short, animated skeleton screen in the form of a shimmer that moves from left to right. Frame-Display Skeleton Screens One variation that we do not recommend is a skeleton screen that displays only the frame of the application without a content wireframe. These minimal skeleton screens only include the header, footer, and the background. This style doesn’t include placeholders of the content, and as a result, doesn’t give users a sense of the general structure of the page. A frame display is not recommended because, if users are forced to wait for too long, they will assume the page isn’t working because the screen is mostly blank. NBC displays only the frame of the page, with a pulsing background gradient used to communicate that the page is loading. However, this skeleton screen is essentially equivalent to a spinner , since it doesn’t include any information about the page structure. Benefits of Using Skeleton Screens Skeleton screens help the user understand that the page is loading, while also communicating what the page will look like. Here are a few reasons why you might consider using skeleton screens: Prevent the user from thinking that the site isn’t working. When a user visits a site or an application and they come across a blank screen while the page is loading, they may assume something is wrong and leave. Skeleton screens help users focus on the content being loaded and give them something to look at while waiting. Create the illusion of a shorter wait time. Long loading times annoy users. Because a skeleton screen looks like a wireframe, it creates the illusion that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. The indication of progress gives users a sense that it won’t take a long time to load. Reduce users’ cognitive load . Instead of overwhelming users by showing them a blank page first and then immediately a full page of content, skeleton screens help users process what the page will look like and give them time to develop mental models of the page structure before they are bombarded with a lot of information at once. For example, when users see a big square with a little box under it, they will know to expect an image with a caption. Are Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners? Skeleton screens, progress bars, and spinners all show that the system is loading information, but they serve different purposes and work best in different situations. Here are a few guidelines to help you make the decision on when to use each design. Waiting-Period Lengths Matter Spinners or wait animations provide feedback to users that the system is working but don’t give any indication on how long users will have to wait; therefore, they are best used when the page takes 2–10 seconds to load. Similarly, skeleton screens should be used with a wait time that’s under 10 seconds. On the other hand, progress bars are strongly recommended for any page that takes longer that 10 seconds to load because they give users a sense of the state of the system and of how much longer they have to wait. Anything above 10 seconds requires an explicit estimation of duration. For waiting periods less than 10 seconds, both skeleton screens and spinners could work . How do you decide between the two? Spinners are typically best used on a single module, like a video or a card which is on a dashboard. Skeleton screens (with the exception of frame-display ones) are better when the full screen is loading because the wireframe gives users a sense of what the page will look like and, thus, minimizes cognitive load. No Skeleton Screens or Spinners for Quick Page Loads If a page takes less than 1 second to load, skeleton screens or spinners aren’t necessary, as they likely won’t make a difference to the users’ experience. Using a skeleton screen in such situations can be annoying because the quick flashing page can cause users to feel like they can’t keep up. Progress Bars Are Best for Process-Related Indicators Skeleton screens are used to indicate progress only when the process that the system is performing is a full-page load. Whenever some other process (e.g., download, upload, convert a file) is involved, it does not make sense (and could even be confusing) to show a skeleton screen. Instead, show a progress bar or a wizard that walks the user through the steps of the process. Do Not Use a Frame-Display Skeleton Screen Frame-display skeleton screens display no information about the page layout; they show only a header, footer, and an empty background. They should not be used as a progress indicator because they do not give users any sense that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. If users end up having to wait for a long time, they will assume the page is not working and abandon it. Conclusion Users generally get impatient by long loading periods. Skeleton screens ease the pain of waiting for medium-length durations by showing the page structure in a gradual manner, through placeholders and subtle animations. While skeleton screens are useful, they do not replace performance-optimization efforts. Skeleton screens are simply one extra tool for improving the wait users sometimes have to experience when content is loading. References Thomas Mejtoft, Arvid Långström, and Ulrik Söderström. 2018.

Skeleton states and the loading component are two visual indicators that communicate that data is loading and that the screen is not frozen. Overview Skeleton states Loading indicators Progressive loading Load more options Accessibility Related References Feedback Overview Loading strategies assure users that their request is in progress and can create the illusion of shorter load times in apps. According to research conducted by the Nielsen Norman Group, skeleton states and other loading indicators improve user satisfaction. In this pattern, we will look at skeleton states, loading indicators, and progressive loading. Skeleton states Skeleton states are simplified versions of components used on an initial page load to indicate that the information on the page has not fully loaded yet. They should only appear for only a few seconds, disappearing once components and content populate the page. Example of a skeleton state Skeleton states use motion to convey that the page is not stuck and that data is still being loaded. This can help to reduce user uncertainty . Only use skeleton states on container-based components like tiles and structured lists or data-based components like data tables and cards. In most cases, action components (e.g. buttons, input fields, checkboxes, toggles) do not need to have a skeleton state. Never represent toast notifications, overflow menus, dropdown items, modals, and loaders with skeleton states. Elements inside a modal may have a skeleton state, but the modal itself should not. Loading indicators Loading indicators signal a user action is processing. Unlike progress bars, loading indicators only signal that loading is occurring and do not give any indication of progress. If a process will take more than a moment or two to complete, use a progress indicator instead. Full-screen loading indicators tell a user the entire application is processing, while inline indicators show that a specific selection or action is processing. Full-screen loading The loading component should be used when the entire page is processing. This is often applied after data is submitted or saved by the user. If the process is going to take more than a few minutes, consider including a notification . Example of a progress indicator in an application When to use An action temporarily disables the application If a user’s action temporarily disables the application while processing occurs, use a loading indicator and a full-screen overlay. Processing takes more than a few seconds If a loading process will require the application’s full resources and will take longer than a moment or two, use a full-screen loading indicator. Data from user input is being saved or submitted Saving data following with user input often takes a few moments. Using a loading indicator allows the application to finish processing before allowing the user to continue. Inline loading Use the inline loading component when a single component is processing. For example, when an administrator invites a user, an inline loading component indicates the system is processing the invite request. Example of an inline loading indicator Progressive loading Progressive loading is a technique that loads pages in batches. The simplest view of the page loads first, followed by progressively more detailed batches until the entire viewport has loaded. The primary batch should show a page’s basic structure (the skeleton state versions of the container-based components), data-based text (the skeleton state version of text) and non-data text. Following batches can include images, content outside of the viewport, interactive (action-based) components, and data-based text. Not all items need a skeleton state and instead can be expressed as negative or white space until they load. For example, a 600 x 600px image can be shown as a 600 x 600px area of white space until the full image loads. Phases of progressive loading When to use A page view is slow to load Pages that source data from multiple sources, such as dashboards, and can be slow to load. A user changes filters or facets in a table view Tables may be sourcing information from large data sets and so processing may take a few moments. Load more options A Load more option can be used to extend a list where only a small fraction of options are displayed. It can also be used in cases where the list of options is populated via a database. Using Load more allows the data to load in progressive batches. Example of Load more Accessibility A screen reader should notify a user if an application is loading, busy, gets stuck, or if a process fails. For specific loading accessibility concerns, see the WCAG documentation for Notification of Loading/Busy and adhere to accessibility guidelines for the loading component .

Over 30 years ago, Jakob Nielsen created 10 Usability Heuristics as general guidelines for designing digital products. These heuristics equally apply today as they did back then. Usability heuristic #9 emphasizes the importance of good error-message design: \"Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors.\" Effectively handling errors is crucial because it's one of the 5 quality components of usable experiences. Error message : A system-generated interruption to the user's workflow that informs the user of an incomplete, incompatible, or undesirable situation according to the system's implementation. Quality and error messages rarely go together, though. Product teams can be so focused on designing or engineering the idealistic user path that deviations from that path become a frustrating afterthought. In This Article: Visibility Guidelines Communication Guidelines Efficiency Guidelines Mitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations Conclusion Visibility Guidelines Error messages must present themselves noticeably and recognizably to users. Display the error message close to the error's source. Reduce cognitive load by displaying an error indicator adjacent to the interface where the error occurred. Proximity helps users associate the error message content with the interface elements needing attention. Bad: When the user adds an unrecognizable URL to their Instagram profile, the resulting error message is subtly styled and positioned far away from the URL field. Use noticeable, redundant, and accessible indicators. Text and highlights that are bold, high-contrast, and red are conventional error-message visuals. Use this styling for the message and for the affected elements needing correction. Another technique for improving noticeability is leveraging carefully designed animations to guide the user's visual attention for corrections. Remember accessibility guidelines to aid the roughly 350 million people worldwide with a color-vision deficiency, and never use exclusively color or animation to indicate errors. Good: Amazon utilizes several techniques to indicate an error: border highlighting, iconography, and red text. Good: CafePress displays an animated banner to attract the user’s attention to the blank customization field. Design errors based on their impact. Design your error messages to indicate the problem's severity. For example, sometimes users only need to be warned of unexpected or potentially undesirable outcomes but can otherwise advance their workflow. Differentiate between these \"good to know\" messages from those posing a barrier to the user's progress. For example, conditionally displayed labels, toast notifications, or banners can be used for issues needing minimal user interaction, whereas modal dialogs require the user's attention and resolution and should be reserved for severe errors. Good: Kohl’s uses a message without conventional red formatting to notify users about potential shipping delays. Avoid prematurely displaying errors. Timing is a crucial aspect of designing effective error messages. Presenting errors too early is a hostile pattern . It’s like grading a test before the student has had a chance to answer. It can make users feel annoyed, belittled, or confused. Don't assume that exploratory interactions (like the user moving text focus from a text box without filling it in) are errors. However, do consider inline, real-time errors for error-prone interactions where users are unlikely to enter the correct information on their first try. This immediate guidance reduces interaction costs for correction. Good: CLEAR provides clear, accessible indicators close to the text input about meeting specific password requirements, which could be a highly error-prone interaction. Bad: This Texas vehicle-registration–renewal page displays an error if the email text input loses focus while empty, which suggests the user did something wrong by merely exploring the interface. Communication Guidelines Error messages cannot rely on visuals alone. They must contain copy to elaborate and assist the user with recovering from the error. Use human-readable language. Error messages should be plainspoken using legible and readable text (many writing apps can give you feedback on a message's readability). Avoid technical jargon and use language familiar to your users instead. The Web's most common error message, the 404 page, violates this guideline. Hide or minimize the use of obscure error codes or abbreviations; show them for technical diagnostic purposes only. Concisely and precisely describe the issue. Generic messages such as An error occurred lack context. Provide descriptions of the exact problems to help users understand what happened. That said, beware of excessive technical precision and accuracy that can undermine understandability. The user's mental model of how the system works likely differs from the conceptual model of how it was coded. Bad: When searching for dining locations with very narrow filters, Disneyworld obfuscates the lack of results with puns instead of clearly conveying the situation. Offer constructive advice. Merely stating the problem is also not enough; offer some potential remedies. One example is an Out of stock message for an ecommerce website. Include details of when the product will be available again or suggest that users sign up for a restock notification by entering their emails. Take a positive tone and don't blame the user. Write with a positive and nonjudgmental tone of voice . Don't use phrasing that blames users or implies they are doing something wrong, such as invalid , illegal , or incorrect . The proper usage of any system lies with its creators and not with the system's users, so the system must gracefully adapt and not shift blame. Avoid humor since it can become stale if users encounter the error frequently. Good: Target gives clear feedback that users must spend more to qualify for same-day shipping. Note how the message avoids blaming the user for not purchasing enough and focuses instead on the threshold. Bad: The National Geographic Kids website does not explain itself if an underage user clicks on the shop. A better message would clarify that only adults can use the shop and that the user should ask for their help. Efficiency Guidelines Good errors go beyond just explaining but protect the user's effort and time. Offer accelerators to resolve the situation or share a bit of instruction to aid users' understanding and hopefully avoid the problem in the future. Safeguard against likely mistakes. The very worst error messages are those that don't exist. When users make a mistake and receive no feedback, it can create a cascade of misunderstanding, wasted effort, and frustration. Years ago, email apps would dutifully send your email even though it referred to an attachment you forgot to include. Now, most apps will detect this situation and prompt you with an error message before sending it, thus sparing you embarrassment. Good: Email apps have evolved to detect and warn about common email mistakes, such as forgetting to include attachments. Preserve the user's input. Let users correct errors by editing their original action instead of starting over. For example, display the original text entered into a text field even if it does not match the requirements for that field and allow the user to modify it. Good: If the user navigates back while adding an image to an Instagram story, the system provides an option to save their work as a draft to avoid losing it. Reduce error-correction effort. If possible, guess the correct action and let users pick it from a small list of fixes. For example, instead of just saying City and ZIP code don't match, let users click on a button for the city that matches the ZIP code they entered. Concisely educate on how the system works . Explain to your users how the system works and how to resolve an error. If additional information is required, use hypertext links to connect a concise error message to a page with supplementary material or an explanation of the problem. (Don't overdo this, though.) Good: Vistaprint communicates what will happen to text placed outside the printable area for a custom shirt. Bad: Although Zazzle displays guides for a shirt's printable area, it does not warn the user about the cut-off text, potentially resulting in designing and purchasing an undesired shirt. Mitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations The above guidelines are essential and applicable to all error messages. That said, there is one last guideline to consider when the system becomes incapable of serving users in any functional capacity: Mitigate total failure with novelty. Errors are unenjoyable for everyone involved as they interfere with user and business goals. Yet sometimes users may encounter an error so catastrophic (e.g., overloaded servers) there is no recourse but to wait or try again later. It's these specific moments (which should be rare and avoided at all costs) where blending an apology with something surprising or novel may salvage a disappointing situation that users will likely remember due to negativity bias and the peak-end rule . Don't underestimate the challenge of communicating humility and delight — especially if user input is in jeopardy or the context has severe implications for users. Yet this tactic might enhance memorability and sustain user interest with low-stakes experiences until the system resumes functioning. Good: Generative AI experiences like ChatGPT can use downtime to entertain and teach users about its open-ended capabilities until the service is restored. Good: Although Twitter stopped using the \"Fail Whale\" (by artist Yiying Lu) to notify users of service disruptions, the image transcended its error-message status and became famous for its whimsical depiction of effort. Conclusion Interactions between humans and computers are constantly evolving, but there will inevitably be mistakes, misunderstandings, and, thus, a need for error messages. Follow these guidelines to ease these frustrating moments and help the user accomplish their task efficiently and with renewed confidence.

Forms are necessary components of many applications and websites. They are used to log in, purchase items, send feedback, enter personal information, and more. When mistakes are made in forms, good error messages and thoughtful error flows can easily guide users to fixes. In This Article: Principles of Designing Error-Correction Flows 1.

Don’t Use Validation Summaries as the Only Indication of an Error 9. Don’t Use Tooltips to Report Errors 10. Provide Extra Help for Repeated Errors Conclusion Principles of Designing Error-Correction Flows An error flow should allow users to easily fix their mistakes and proceed with their tasks. Effective error design makes sure that: Error messages are easily noticed and understood. The field(s) in error are easy to locate. Instructions for fixing errors are visible when the error is fixed. This article contains practical guidelines for designing error flows in forms. 1. Aim for Inline Validation Whenever Possible Ideally, all validation should be inline ; that is, as soon as the user has finished filling in a field, an indicator should appear nearby if the field contains an error. This approach reduces interaction cost for the user by allowing them to fix errors immediately, without searching or returning to a field they thought was completed correctly. Sometimes inline validation is not possible, and data entered by the user must be sent to a server for verification. In these cases, make sure error messages are clear, actionable, and easy to locate when the form or page is reloaded. 2. Indicate Successful Entry for Complex Fields Inline validation can also be used to indicate successful completion of fields. For example, when the user creates a username, a green checkmark and a message that the username is available provide clear feedback. For complex inputs such as new passwords, instant inline validation (which appears as the field value is being typed) will prevent users from guessing or checking multiple times if what they’ve entered meets the system's guidelines. In the example below, the password-strength indicator changes as the user types and helps the user decide if the string entered is good enough or if more characters need to be added. Slack indicated password rules and also provided instant validation by showing a password-strength meter as the user typed. However, don’t go overboard with success indicators. Success indicators shouldn’t distract users from filling out forms and should only be used when the additional context helps complete the form faster or more accurately. For example, you don’t need to show a success message when the only requirement on the field is that it is filled in, as that message won’t provide much additional context to your user. 3. Keep Error Messages Next to Fields With inline validation, error messages are naturally shown next to the field causing the error. But even when the fields are not validated inline, it’s helpful to show an actionable error message below or next to the problem field in order to help the user fix the error. The message should f ollow error-message guidelines : it should be explicit, human-readable, polite, precise, and give constructive advice. Keeping error messages next to the fields in error minimizes working-memory load: users can see the error message while fixing the error instead of having to remember it. 4. Use Color to Differentiate Errors from Normal Field States Red is the color most associated with errors, along with orange or yellow for warnings and green or blue for success. Make sure that the validation text stands out from the rest of the form so the user will notice it quickly. Add a semitransparent background of the same color to the error field to make it stand out on a long page with many form fields. 5. Add Iconography or Subtle Animation for Easy Scanning In addition to color, an icon to the left of your error message or validation summary will draw attention to the error and help users who are colorblind. When the user scans the form, the icon will stand out and draw the eye to what needs to be fixed. Adobe.com: The red color and the icon next to the error message drew users’ attention. A subtle pulse or bounce animation on the icon corresponding to an error can further draw users’ attention to the error. However, don’t abuse animation: several animated icons can be overwhelming if there are multiple errors. And don’t animate text — animated error messages are hard to read. 6. Use Modals or Confirmation Dialogs Sparingly When you need to draw extra attention to a potential error, use a modal or confirmation dialog to explain details and help the user fix the issue. However, use such dialogs sparingly as they have two big disadvantages: They are disruptive. The error message appears in a window that must be dismissed before fixing the error, forcing users to remember complex instructions and increasing cognitive load . Modal dialogs are, however, okay if the error message is simple or the form could still be submitted as it is. Gmail.com used a modal to warn the users that the attachment was missing. This error presentation is suitable because the error message is fairly simple, and the user can choose to proceed without including an attachment. 7. Don’t Validate Fields Before Input is Complete In most cases, avoid showing an error until the user has finished with the field and moved to the next field. It’s frustrating to see an error message before being given the opportunity to finish typing. When placing an order on BestBuy.com, an error message appeared in the Email Address field after the user navigated away from it. However, going back to fix the error prompted another error to appear in the Phone Number field, although the user had not started typing in that field. 8. Don’t Use Validation Summaries as the Only Indication of an Error A validation summary is shown at the top of a form and lets users know that there are errors that need to be fixed on the page, whether those errors are in the viewport or below the fold. A validation summary can give the user a global understanding of all the errors in a form but shouldn’t be used as the only form of error indication, as it forces the user to search for the field in error; moreover, the error message may no longer be present in the viewport when the user reaches the error field, thus forcing the user to memorize the error message while fixing the issue. SurveyMonkey provided error messages at the top of the form as well as below the specific field(s) causing errors. 9. Don’t Use Tooltips to Report Errors Tooltips are sometimes used to indicate errors, typically with an alert icon displayed next to the field(s) in error. When users hover over the icon or focus on the field, a tooltip or a toast containing the error message appears. This approach is generally not recommended for a few reasons: Alert icons are hard to notice , especially on visually dense interfaces. Users may not realize that an error message is displayed and wonder what is wrong with the field without realizing that they need to hover or focus to see the message. It adds unnecessary effort , requiring users to take extra steps to access critical information. Facebook.com: The errors in the signup form were displayed as alert icons. Users had to click on each one to see what the problem was. While in this example, the errors are easy to infer, it would be harder to do so if the fields were filled in. 10. Provide Extra Help for Repeated Errors When users encounter the same error repeatedly (3 or more times in a single form-filling attempt), it indicates a deeper issue in the user interface — unclear error messages, a mismatch between the design and users’ needs, or overly complex requirements in the form. Remember that when users make errors, it’s not their fault. Errors highlight flaws in your design. Quicken provided a link to a contact form to get in touch with support if repeated errors occur. To address repeated errors: Review analytics data for error patterns to identify common scenarios where errors occur. Test and refine the design to uncover the root cause of errors. Revise error messages to provide more actionable feedback. Conclusion Error flows should be designed to help users fix mistakes in a form and help them avoid making more. Ensure that users can easily detect errors, understand how to fix them, and see the error message while correcting the corresponding error. Remove the guesswork and let users get on with their tasks.

No one wants to commit an error — in life or while using an application or website. Making a mistake — while a natural part of life and often an opportunity for learning — can cause damage, result in tedious extra work, and just make people feel flustered or ashamed for not knowing exactly how to do something. It makes sense then that not one, but two of Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics are devoted to errors: Heuristic #5 is error prevention . This guideline states that we should prevent problems from occurring by eliminating error-prone conditions or by providing a confirmation option before users commit to actions with serious consequences. Heuristic #9 is help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors . Error messages should be expressed in plain language, communicate the problem and a solution, and make use of visual styling that will help users notice them. When designing digital experiences, prioritizing error prevention and recovery is a commendable and worthwhile strategy. But some well-meaning designs attempting to adhere to these heuristics take it too far, subjecting users to overly aggressive patterns that are frustrating and distracting rather than helpful. Overly aggressive patterns for error prevention and recovery can be avoided by following these 2 guidelines: Avoid premature error messages: Display error messages only after the error has been made. Reserve error styling for errors only: Limit use of error-like visual treatments (e.g., red text, caution and warning symbols) for critical system-status messages that are meant to disrupt the users’ workflow. This article provides examples and guidelines for avoiding these pitfalls. In This Article: #1: Avoid Premature Error Messages #2: Reserve Error Styling for Errors Only Conclusion #1: Avoid Premature Error Messages Premature error messages are error messages that are presented by the system too early — before the user has reached a fair and reasonable point in the workflow to have truly committed an error or not. Consider a user filling out a form — a common task on many websites and applications. Ideally, and when technical constraints allow, it’s best to inform users of any form errors in real time , as they are committed. But many form validation triggers are too impulsive, displaying error messages before the user has had a chance to finish filling in the field. One such case is when a system displays an error message before the user is finished typing a value in a form field with a predetermined, correct format. The error message is displayed as soon as the user begins typing, even when they have not veered off course from the predetermined format. (In other words, typing a “2” in a phone number field should not trigger an error message; whereas displaying an error message as soon as a letter is typed in the phone-number field would be appropriate.) For example, LG’s checkout process displays a premature error message as soon as the user begins typing numbers into the ZIP code field and maintains that error message until the number of characters reaches the predetermined format. While displaying the error message inline (beside the field it is related to) is useful, the error message itself is unwarranted: no mistake has been made. (Adding to the noise, a second, redundant message is also triggered and displayed at the bottom of the form.) LG’s website displays a premature error message about ZIP code format as soon as the user begins typing in the field. The error message persists until 5 characters have been typed. Labcorp (a medical-billing company) uses a similar pattern on its payment portal. As soon as a letter is typed into the email-address field, the error message Invalid email address immediately assaults the user. Labcorp’s payment portal displays the premature error message Invalid email address as soon as the user begins typing in the Email Address field. In another example, attempting to fill in birth date information during Sorel’s checkout process triggers the in-line message Please enter a valid date. Sorel.com: The premature error message Please enter a valid date is triggered before the user can finish entering the information in the birth date fields. As a general rule of thumb, avoid displaying the error until the user has finished with the field and moved to the next field. Displaying error messages while the user types feels like an unwarranted scolding and can be irritating. An even more frustrating variation of premature inline validation is the error message that appears before the user even begins typing. This type of error message is either triggered as soon as the user clicks into the field or, worse, appears in the default state of the form before any interaction takes place. In these cases, the user isn’t even given the chance to begin filling in the field before being admonished. During the reservation process for Hilton’s Conrad New York hotel, clicking into the field for Last name causes the field to be outlined in red and triggers the inline error message Please enter a last name below the field. These error indicators would useful if the user skipped that field and attempted to submit the form, but they should not be triggered by simply clicking into the field. (To make matters worse, all fields contain the word “optional” before the user interacts with them, even the Last name field displaying the inline error message.) Conradnewyork.com: The inline validation message Please enter a last name is displayed as soon as the user clicks into the field. In an even more aggressive approach , the Xpress-pay patient-payment portal below displays the error message Amount cannot be blank before the user even interacts with the field. What’s more, in addition to the error message, there are 3 additional redundant indicators that the Amount field is required: an asterisk by the field label, an icon with an exclamation mark in the far right of the field, and a bold, red outline around the form field itself. This Xpress-pay payment portal displays the in-line error message Amount cannot be blank before the user interacts with the field, along with an onslaught of redundant indicators for the required field (an asterisk, a warning icon, and a red border around the field). Of course, in any form, we recommend explicitly communicating which fields are required — but an asterisk is generally sufficient. Providing redundant or additional aggressively styled indicators that a field is required serves no end, and it feels combative. The inline, error message Amount cannot be blank would be useful if displayed after a user attempted to submit this form without filling in the required field. Displayed prematurely, it is overkill at best and annoying at worst. #2: Reserve Error Styling for Errors Only Another aggressive pattern is using error-like visual treatments in situations where errors have not actually occurred. One such case is styling noncritical system-status messages with visual treatments better suited for warnings and errors. Critical error messages and warnings should be intrusive. When errors display, the user is likely paying attention to the task at hand, not thinking about the error, so the error message should disrupt the work enough to gain the user’s attention. Therefore, intrusive styling for errors (e.g., red text or visual treatment, caution symbols, warning signs) makes sense. But routine system-status messages that communicate noncritical information should not be disruptive. They should be discoverable, but not intrusive. In the HR application below, the message There are no attachments to display is styled like a warning. The information seems more important than it really is, due to the yellow visual treatment and the caution symbol. Users who encounter this message will be disrupted, pausing to consider “ Should there be an attachment?” (Because uploading an attachment is optional in this case, the answer is: It doesn’t matter.) In this application, the noncritical information There are no attachments to display is styled like a warning (with a yellow background and caution symbol). Yellow coloring and caution icons (such as an exclamation mark in a triangle) are best reserved for warnings in situations where failure or significant change has occurred or is likely to occur, but where irrevocable damage has not or will not occur. For example, the Amazon Glow application appropriately uses a yellow caution icon to inform the user that a call has failed. Amazon Glow’s mobile application uses a yellow caution icon to indicate a failed call. In another example, during a checkout process for the online bookstore Thrift Books, clicking into any form field under Billing Address triggers the message Please ensure that your address is correct, it can’t be changed once your order is submitted . While this information is useful, the red visual treatment and caution symbol make it look like an error message. The user must pause and process the message, doublechecking that an error has not occurred, while there is nothing to fix. Furthermore, the message introduces the question: Why can’t the address be changed? (This violates the heuristic of error recovery.) Thriftbooks.com: In this checkout process, the red visual treatment and caution symbol make useful information feel like an error message and create the perception that the user has made a mistake. Useful information that is not error related, such as this, is better presented without error-like visual treatment. For example, in Paypal’s mobile application, similar information is styled without red font or background coloring and with an information icon in place of the warning icon. Paypal’s mobile application displays nonerror notifications with subtle gray background coloring and an information icon (a lowercase i in a circle). Conclusion These aggressive strategies for error prevention and recovery are akin to standing over the shoulder of a user and shouting “ YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG! ” during a workflow. They can be perceived as offensive and cause undo frustration. Bottom line: Let’s assist users, not admonish them. Follow these guidelines to effectively support error prevention and recovery without making users feel assaulted or shamed: Wait until a user moves on from a field to display an error message related to an appropriate format (e.g., ZIP code, email address). Provide any constraints upfront; do not wait until the user begins typing or attempts to submit the entry. Use an asterisk to mark required fields or annotate required fields with the word required . Do not overload the user with multiple indicators (e.g., asterisk and red outlined field and inline validation message). Display additional elements if and after the user attempts to submit a form or page without filling in required fields. Reserve error-like visual treatments (e.g., red text, caution, and warning symbols) for critical system-status messages that are meant to disrupt the users’ workflow.

Design for messy situations like name changes, shared accounts, and bad actors from day one. Let's talk about something uncomfortable. You know that beautiful user flow you mapped out? The one where everything works perfectly? That one that works great for most of your users most of the time. The problem, of course, is the users it doesn’t work for. They're stuck dealing with divorced parents sharing custody calendars, trying to access their accounts after their phone got stolen in Barcelona, or attempting to use your app while their internet cuts out every few minutes because they live in rural Montana. In This Article: Edge Cases Are Tough The Cases We Don't Think About The Cases We Don't Want to Think About The Technical Realities We Avoid Accessibility as an Afterthought Stop Designing for Perfect People Edge Cases Are Tough These are all examples of edge cases. An edge case is a rare or unexpected scenario that typically involves unusual user inputs, extreme data values, or uncommon usage patterns that weren't anticipated during the primary design and testing phases. Sometimes the rarest of them will be called corner cases. Not every deviation from the happy path is that unusual, though. Some things we think of as exceptions are surprisingly common. Almost every one of your users will run into at least one of the following problems at some point, if they stick around long enough. The Cases We Don't Think About When edge cases fall through the cracks in our designs, it’s often because they’re scenarios designers would rather not consider. Name Changes The Scenario Someone gets married, divorced, or transitions. Simple, right? Just change the name field. Except now their old name is baked into URLs, email notifications still use the old name, and other users can't find them because search works only with the original name. While a name change might not be an everyday occurrence for any given individual, it happens to somebody somewhere every day, and it should be easy for that person to handle it on their own, without having to jump through hoops. Design Better Make names editable and reflect those changes everywhere in the product – even in URLs. Plan for gradual rollouts where both names work, at least temporarily, by default. For example, if somebody’s email changes, have the old address forward to the new one, or if somebody needs to be found in a directory, have the old name redirect to the new. Don’t be too strict on name-validation fields. If somebody wants to present themselves as “Pat NewName (formerly OldName),” you should allow that. This approach also has the benefit of not annoying people who have spaces or punctuation in their names, which is very common in many parts of the world. Consider that some users need their old names completely scrubbed for safety reasons. This may mean allowing the user to override the previous suggestion to make both names searchable! Both use cases are perfectly valid, and giving the user control over how they are presented to the world is always a good choice. Account Lockouts The Scenario An email account gets hacked. A phone falls in the toilet. An authentication app gets corrupted. Your user is now permanently locked out of their account with three years of work inside it, and your Contact support form requires them to be logged in to access it. Design Better Have multiple account-recovery options that don't all depend on the same device. Make your support-contact information findable and usable when someone isn't logged in. Multiple Accounts The Scenario Your user has a work account and a personal account, or maybe they're a freelancer with separate accounts for each client. Your product treats this situation like they're trying to game the system instead of recognizing it as a completely normal use case. Design Better Account switching should be trivial. Don’t make people log out and back in every single time they want to change. In some cases, you can let people sign in once and then create multiple subaccounts or just associate multiple accounts with the same login information. For example, if a user has a work account and a personal account on a social media site or a teleconferencing app, they shouldn’t have to manage everything separately. For bonus points, allow users to share global settings across all their accounts . Users shouldn’t have to upload their profile picture or set their preferences multiple times if they don’t want to. On the other hand, don’t require any shared settings. There are lots of great reasons to have different settings for work accounts and personal accounts. Very few people want to sign into their work Zoom and have all their coworkers see their character name and avatar from their weekly Dungeons and Dragons session. Shared Accounts The Scenario While your beautiful user model probably focuses on individuals, real people share accounts. Couples share streaming services. Families share photo storage. Sometimes one partner goes on a work trip, so both people will be using a product or service at the same time from different locations. Not everybody is doing this to avoid paying you extra fees. Sometimes it just makes sense to have linked accounts. Many family plans allow people to track their movies or music separately depending on who is using the device. That way they don’t end up getting recommendations to watch a Disney movie on date night or a horror flick when they’re watching with the kids. If your product is likely to be used on a shared device like a television or an iPad, give users profiles and let them decide who the user really is. Design Better Acknowledge shared accounts exist. Build features for legitimate account sharing like separate profiles and child safety features. Make it clear when sharing might be problematic for security without being punitive. Make it possible for people to disentangle their profiles and make separate accounts for perfectly normal reasons like break ups or kids going off to college, so they don’t lose all their data. The Cases We Don't Want to Think About Bad Actors The Scenario Someone's angry ex is harassing them through your platform. Trolls are gaming your community features to abuse other users. Your reporting system requires users to relive their trauma by documenting everything in detail, and even when bad actors are kicked out, they just make a new account and are back in no time. This can happen anywhere, even your enterprise product meant only to be used by teams at work. We want to believe that everyone using our products is going to be a good citizen and treat others with respect and empathy. Unfortunately, over 40 years of electronic communication through bulletin boards, instant-messaging systems, and social media (plus thousands of years of…you know…observing humanity) have proven this is very much not the case! Scammers, grifters, and griefers will constantly test your systems for vulnerabilities and use your products in ways you might personally find horrifying. The truth is that we’ve been building digital, connected products for far too long for you to pretend not to know this is coming. If you don’t design to prevent harassment and intentionally harmful misuse, users will assume you simply don’t care about the people being hurt. Design Better Build safety features from the ground up, not only as a response to problems. Make blocking and reporting easy and effective. Introduce some friction in account creation to make it difficult for people to automate abusive behaviors through infinite sock-puppet accounts. Test your trust and safety guidelines by actively considering the worst-case scenarios. Don’t forget to do research, or even better, codesign, with folks who have experienced this sort of harassment. A Deceased User The Scenario Death is the ultimate edge case nobody wants to design for. Your user's spouse dies, and suddenly they can't access the shared photo account because it was tied to their partner's email. Or worse — every time they open your app, they're confronted with notifications asking: Where's Mike? Invite him to collaborate! In some of the worst cases, users have been reminded of the deaths of loved ones by automatically created photo retrospectives or anniversary celebrations of posts on sites like Facebook. In this case, you not only need to plan for the eventual deaths of your users but also the deaths of anybody who is in any way a part of your system. If your users have taken pictures of a loved one, a friend, or a pet, those individuals might not always be around. An unexpected reminder of somebody who has passed away can be deeply traumatic, and you absolutely do not want your users to experience it on your platform when they’re trying to enjoy themselves. Design Better Build memorial or legacy modes for existing users that can persist in some way after they are gone, while still recognizing the fact that they are no longer alive. Let users designate trusted contacts to manage their digital legacies online. Do not send collaboration invites to inactive accounts after a reasonable period. Let people opt out of potentially sensitive email notifications around holidays or promotions. Do not autocreate “fun” retrospectives of images or posts that may include terrible memories, or, at least, let users easily opt out of them or designate certain pictures off limits. The Technical Realities We Avoid Unconsidered edge cases also happen when a use case feels too complex or messy from a technical perspective. Collaboration The Scenario Three people try to edit the same document. Two of them have slow internet, and one of them is on mobile. Your real-time collaboration feature becomes a real-time disaster with changes getting lost and confusion mounting. Or, even worse, you simply don’t have any collaboration features built into your system, so people end up emailing around files with ever expanding titles like Presentation_final_v3.5.key. Design Better Design for both asynchronous and real-time collaboration. Show clear conflict resolution. Make it obvious when someone's changes aren't saving. When there is a merge conflict between various edits, ask for guidance from the users. Enable change tracking and the ability to accept or reject changes. Data Exports The Scenario Your user wants to leave your platform. They've got three years of data they need to take with them. Your export feature generates a CSV that's missing half their information and is completely unusable in other tools. This one sometimes makes product managers roll their eyes a little. After all, who cares what happens if somebody is leaving the platform? They’re not your problem any longer if they’re not your user! It turns out that many governments care quite deeply! Not only is this good practice, but, in many jurisdictions, it’s also the law that people be able to take their data with them when they leave. Besides, just because your product isn’t right for a specific person doesn’t mean you want them telling other people how awful it was to leave your platform. Make it easy for folks to say nice things about you, even when they’re leaving, and make it an easy decision to come back some day when their needs change. Design Better Export should be a first-class feature, not an afterthought. Test your exports by importing them somewhere else. Consider formats that preserve relationships and metadata. Slow Connections The Scenario Your users travel or live in areas with spotty internet. They work in buildings with terrible WiFi. Sometimes they take the subway. Your app becomes a beautiful, useless loading screen whenever the connection drops. As somebody who spent several years riding BART into San Francisco and having 90% of the apps on my phone work sporadically, if at all, on my commute, I am begging you to do as much as possible to make things work, even without a perfect internet connection. Design Better Offline-first design isn't just for developing countries. Cache intelligently, and, whenever possible, provide some sort of off-line mode. Show clear indicators of sync status. Let users work locally and sync later. Accessibility as an Afterthought Accessibility, while much larger than an individual edge case, is a chronic problem for digital design. And it gets overlooked for similar reasons — it can feel difficult or uncomfortable to consider. Your product works great if you can see perfectly, hear clearly, and use both hands to navigate with precision. For everyone else, it's a frustrating barrier to getting things done. And that “everyone else” is not a small number! Did you know that, according to the CDC, more than 1 in 4 adults in the United States have some type of disability? At some point in our lives, most of us will have to deal with failing eyesight, hearing, or mobility. Obviously, there are a lot of great resources on how to design better for all of the different accessibility requirements. We can’t provide an exhaustive list of dos and don’ts in this article, but be sure to remember that accessibility isn’t a feature to add later. It’s a design constraint to embrace and plan for from day one. Learn how to build accessible products and test them with real assistive technologies and actual users! Stop Designing for Perfect People There are no perfect users living perfect lives with perfect internet connections and perfect intentions. The sooner we design for the messy, complicated (sometimes heartbreaking) reality of how people actually live, the better our products will serve everyone. Your \"edge cases\" aren't always edge cases. They're Tuesday afternoon for a good percentage of your users. The next time you're mapping out user flows or making decisions about new features, ask yourself: What happens when this goes wrong? What happens when life gets complicated? What happens when this feature encounters the chaos of real human existence? Then design for that too.

Yet as we’ve researched this over 10+ years, we’ve found that this question is a red herring: what really matters to the overall UX of checkout is the number of form fields users must consider. However our e-commerce UX benchmark shows that many sites are still including too-many form fields in their checkouts — degrading the overall user experience. In this article, we’ll discuss our large-scale Premium research findings related to checkout steps, checkout form fields, and how both relate to checkout UX: How many steps are in the average checkout flow Why form fields matter more than steps Five specific ways to minimize the number of visible form fields The Average Checkout Length (In Steps) A “checkout step” is any distinct phase in the checkout process that users must complete to finalize a purchase (key examples include creating accounts and entering shipping, billing, and payment information). In 2024, the average checkout has 5.1 steps. Our e-commerce UX benchmark reveals that the average checkout flow for a new user is 5.1 steps long — counting from the shopping cart step to the order review step (both included). This latest number has been surprisingly persistent and remains largely unchanged since we first started tracking the number of checkout steps at large retailers in 2012. Looking closer at the actual step distribution, it’s interesting to note that there continue to be almost no sites with very short checkout flows (1–2 steps, including the cart step), while there’s been a slight increase in the number of 3-step checkouts. On the other end, the ultra-long checkouts with 8 and 9 steps continue to be nearing extinction. As usual, most checkouts remain 5-to-6 steps in length. However, our research indicates that a different aspect of the design impacts users far more than steps: perceived checkout effort . Why Form Fields Matter More than Steps (Checkout Length vs. Checkout Effort) While sounding slightly counterintuitive, what we consistently observe during end user testing is that the number of overall steps in the workflow isn’t the most important or impactful aspect of the user’s checkout experience. Our e-commerce UX benchmark and Premium research findings indicate that, as the number of form fields increase, the overall checkout UX performance decreases. Rather, what’s more important is what the user has to do at each of those steps (up to a certain point at least, as usability does seem to suffer after 8+ checkout steps). Therefore, to increase the performance of your checkout experience, it’s better to ask, “How can we reduce the number of form fields users must consider?” . Indeed, our research shows that, in general, the number of form fields in a checkout impacts overall usability far more than the number of steps. Maxon’s desktop site from 2022 contains an intimidating number of form fields (15) for users to read and complete. In this gaze plot from an earlier round of testing, which accumulates where 32 test participants fixated their eyes while browsing REI’s payment step (first image), note how the participants spent a very large amount of their total attention on the “New REI membership” and “Current REI members” subscription sections, despite the membership being completely irrelevant to the test participants’ purchase. What’s more, we’ve found that most sites need only 8 form fields in total for a checkout flow — yet the average in 2024 was 11.3 form fields (slightly down from 11.8 in 2021 and 12.7 in 2019). This number of fields unnecessarily increases the perceived and actual complexity of a user’s checkout. Thus, to reduce checkout abandonments , the focus should be less on optimizing checkout steps and more on how to reduce the number of form fields users must review or consider to the minimum required for users to complete the checkout process. Note that not only does the number of form fields greatly impact checkout usability , but so do a myriad of other factors — error recovery ( here and here , questionable required fields , and understanding order fulfillment options — which too are unrelated to the number of checkout steps. 5 Ways to Minimize the Number of Form Fields Users Must Consider In the following five sections, we’ll present our test findings for some of the checkout fields users are often asked to consider and explain how to optimize the checkout flow to reduce the total number of fields . 1) Have a Single “Name” Field (89% Don’t) During all of our checkout usability test studies, we’ve observed how users generally think of their name as a single entity. “Oh wait.” This participant at American Eagle typed the street address in the “Last Name” field before realizing there were two separate name fields, forcing her to copy and paste both the street address and last name into the correct fields. Multiple participants at Apple included the recipient’s full name in the “First Name” field, leading them to pause and subsequently revise their entry. As a consequence, when there are multiple name fields, many users will spend time typing out their full name in the “First Name” field. During testing, 42% of participants typed their full name in the “First Name” field at least once. Given how simple it should be to type your name , the needless friction and rework is quite significant. This participant on Currys (UK) during large-scale European testing began to type his second name into the “First Name” field before realizing his mistake. While not a severe issue, it is a very common one. On HP , users are presented with extraneous fields (multiple name and address fields) during mobile checkout. On a mobile device, every unnecessary form field makes the form’s length seem even more unwieldy than on desktop, due to the limited screen size. On mobile sites the issue is more severe, as typing in general is more difficult on mobile. When users notice their error they’ll have to reenter the field (potentially encountering a tap issue), select the text or otherwise delete it, and copy/paste or retype the text into the correct field. A relatively minor interruption on desktop can swiftly become a more trying ordeal as mobile users struggle to navigate the form and keyboard. This participant at Etsy easily input name information, as the single field for “Full name” helped to streamline the task. However, the solution is relatively straightforward : acknowledge users’ tendency to think of their name as a single entity by implementing just one “Full Name” field. When testing sites with a “Full Name” field, only 4% of users briefly hesitated before typing in their full name, and no one had the kind of typing or interaction issues observed in the multiname fields approach. Yet 89% of sites in our e-commerce UX benchmark have more than one “name” field. 2) Hide “Address Line 2” (75% Don’t) At ASOS , multiple participants stopped and doubted how to correctly fill their street address in the “Address 1” and “Address 2” fields, often clicking and moving parts of the street address back and forth, before finally deciding on how to proceed. During testing 30% of participants came to a stop when arriving at “Address Line 2” , and some questioned if their initial “Address Line 1” input was correct. On the other hand, participants who needed to input “Address Line 2” were well aware of this, and actively sought out the field. This participant checking out at Best Buy easily located the link to “Add Apt. #, Suite, Floor” (first image), adding her address’s unit number (second image). Therefore, to further streamline the checkout process for the majority of users, hide “Address Line 2” behind a link. Hiding “Address Line 2” removes a form field that most users don’t need to consider, while those who do need the field are minimally inconvenienced. Furthermore, to vastly reduce the complexity of all address fields, you can instead rely on a fully automatic address lookup feature to insert the user’s full address — hastening users’ progress through this set of fields even more. 3) Hide “Coupon Code” (35% Don’t) “See that it says ‘Enter a promo code’? I would go to Google, go to ‘Crowd Cow promo code’, and see if I could find one.” Upon encountering the “Coupon Code” field, this participant checking out at Crowd Cow immediately left the site to try to find a coupon code for getting a better deal. Similarly, promotional code fields (e.g., “Promo Code”, “Discount Code”, “Coupon Code” ) are widespread in e-commerce, with our e-commerce UX benchmark showing that 70% of sites have them. While perhaps not considered to be a field likely to cause disruption, our testing reveals that most users will at the very least pause briefly to consider the field. Moreover, instead of moving past the field, a subgroup of participants came to a full stop to consider it — and determine if they might be able to find a coupon code to fill in. In the worst cases (in terms of disruption for users) a handful of participants left the site to search for promo codes. In practice, as soon as users have left the checkout to go look for coupons, the chance of them not returning to complete the purchase increases significantly. Yet despite these issues, 35% of sites with promotional code fields display them by default. Adidas offers users the ability to input a promo code in the cart but collapses the field to decrease the emphasis. Instead, “Coupon Code” fields, like “Address Line 2” fields, should be hidden behind a link. (To tackle this issue even more proactively, consider proactively applying any discounts that are applicable to the user’s cart.) 4) Hide “Billing Address” Fields (24% Don’t) At Fat Brain Toys , the form by default displays different shipping and billing addresses, resulting in an unnecessary number of form fields on the page. At 24% of e-commerce sites the default design is to assume different shipping and billing addresses are needed. This results in the majority of the sites’ users, who only have a home address, being needlessly intimidated by the large number of form fields presented on the page. When both billing and shipping addresses are displayed, most users are effectively shown an entirely redundant set of fields. At Lowes , the “Billing Address” fields are hidden by default. The subgroup of users who need a separate billing address simply have to uncheck the checkbox to be provided with those fields. “Yeah. Same as the delivery address, yeah. Okay.” On Zalando.de , this participant was able to very easily confirm that the billing address was the same as that she had entered in the shipping address form. With a hidden billing address form, users don’t have to work out what a billing address is, they just have to accept the default value — while still having the option of specifying a different billing address if needed. The solution is to set “Billing Address = Shipping Address” by default. Furthermore, how you implement this is important: when you set the “Billing Address is the same as Shipping” (or vice versa) checkbox to be selected by default, the billing address fields should be hidden altogether (rather than autofilled). ( An exception to this is sites where the order logs show a large number of customers who actually use different addresses, such as gifting and business-to-business sites.) 5) Delay the Account Creation (84% Don’t) At H&amp;M , users at the account-selection step are offered a chance to create an account. Note that many guest users would select this option, rather than the guest option below, given that it appears above the guest option and the microcopy is “New Customer” , which many guest users will undoubtedly be. The resulting form is long and intimidating, which will dissuade many users from completing account creation — and may also lead to some abandoning the checkout in the process. Requiring users to create an account to check out, or even nudging them to (e.g., by making account creation prominent on the Account Selection Step ), will result in at least some users being forced to consider fields like “Create a Password” and “Birthdate” — which may cause some to abandon due to the intimidating nature of the checkout process. Indeed, while having users create accounts can be great for both the site and the user, as it can result in more loyal customers for sites and faster checkouts in the future for users, it distracts from the main goal of the checkout process: having users successfully place their order. During testing at Stance (first image) and Williams Sonoma (second image), participants selecting the “Guest Checkout” option were reassured that they could create an account following checkout, allowing them to devote their focus to getting through the checkout process. Instead, during testing we observed that delaying the option to create an account until the Confirmation Step is a better-performing strategy. At the confirmation step, a user has already entered the necessary account details during the checkout; the account-creation work can be reduced to just one or two password fields. Note: when saving account creation for the confirmation step, ensure that users are informed at the account-selection step that they’ll have the option to create an account at the end of the checkout. Users who suspect they will be repeat customers will often want an account, and they may waste time trying to figure out how to create an account if they don’t spot one at the account-selection step and there’s no notice that they’ll be able to create one after checkout. Despite users’ perceived efficiency gains from creating accounts at the confirmation step, 84% of sites fail to do so. Optimizing Checkout UX When it comes to optimizing checkout and UX, it matters much more to users how many form fields they need to consider — rather than the total number of checkout steps they must go through. In this article we’ve highlighted 5 ways to reduce the number of form fields users must contend with. Furthermore, by applying the same reasoning to additional, optional fields (e.g., “Company Name” , “home/work/cell phone number” , “Fax” , etc.) — hiding them behind links — and by providing a “Fully Automatic Address Lookup” feature , you can now present users with only the fields they absolutely need in order to effectively complete their checkout. Crutchfield’s mobile site exemplifies how few form fields are really needed for most checkouts. The optimized checkout process helps ensure users will proceed efficiently through and be able to place their order with minimal friction. Despite the UX performance and conversion rate gains from optimizing the total number of form fields users must contend with, our e-commerce UX benchmark reveals that the vast majority of sites fail to take advantage of ways to minimize the number of fields displayed: Have a single “Name” field (89% don’t) Hide “Address Line 2” (75% don’t) Hide “Coupon Code” (35% don’t) Hide “Billing Address” fields (24% don’t) Have delayed account creation (84% don’t) As a result, the overall UX performance of the checkout suffers — increasing the likelihood that users will abandon due to the perceived difficulty of completing the checkout process.

They are called &quot;heuristics&quot; because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. Thank you to Kelley Gordon for designing the visuals and posters included in this article. Thank you to Kate Moran and Feifei Liu for updating the heuristic names, descriptions, and examples. In This Article: 1: Visibility of System Status 2: Match Between the System and the Real World 3: User Control and Freedom 4: Consistency and Standards 5: Error Prevention 6: Recognition Rather than Recall 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors 10: Help and Documentation Free 10 Heuristics Poster 1: Visibility of System Status The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand. Example of Usability Heuristic #1: You Are Here indicators on mall maps show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next. Tips Communicate clearly to users what the system’s state is — no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them. Present feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately). Build trust through open and continuous communication . Learn more Full article: Visibility of System Status 3-minute video about the Visibility Heuristic 2: Match Between the System and the Real World The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users. When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping ), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive. Example of Usability Heuristic #2: When stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to which heating element. Tips Ensure that users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word’s definition. Never assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that of your users. User research will uncover your users' familiar terminology, as well as their mental models around important concepts. Learn more Full article: Match Between the System and the Real World 2-minute video: Match Between the System and the Real World 3: User Control and Freedom Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process. When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated. Example of Usability Heuristic #3: Digital spaces need quick emergency exits, just like physical spaces do. Tips Support Undo and Redo . Show a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a Cancel button . Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable. Learn more Full article: User Control and Freedom 2-minute video: User Control and Freedom 4: Consistency and Standards Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions. Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours . Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new. Example of Usability Heuristic #4: Checkin counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers’ expectations. Tips Improve learnability by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external. Maintain consistency within a single product or a family of products (internal consistency). Follow established industry conventions (external consistency). Learn more Full article: Consistency and Standards 3-minute video: Consistency and Standards 5: Error Prevention Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. There are two types of errors: slips and mistakes . Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design. Example of Usability Heuristic #5: ​​​​ Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs. Tips Prioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations. Avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults . Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and warning your users . Learn more Full article: Preventing User Errors 3-minute video: Error Prevention 6: Recognition Rather than Recall Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. Humans have limited short-term memories . Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users. Example of Usability Heuristic #6: It’s easier for most people to recognize the capitals of countries, instead of having to remember them. People are more likely to correctly answer the question Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal? rather than What’s the capital of Portugal? Tips Let people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (“recall”) it. Offer help in context , instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize. Reduce the information that users have to remember. Learn more Full article: Recognition vs. Recall in UX 3-minute video: Recognition vs. Recall 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them. Example of Usability Heuristic #7: Regular routes are listed on maps, but locals with knowledge of the area can take shortcuts. Tips Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures. Provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users. Allow for customization , so users can make selections about how they want the product to work. Learn more Full article: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: The 7th Usability Heuristic Explained 3-minute video: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals. Example of Usability Heuristic #8: ​​​​​​ An ornate teapot may have excessive decorative elements, like an uncomfortable handle or hard-to-wash nozzle, that can interfere with usability. Tips Keep the content and visual design of UI focused on the essentials. Don't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need. Prioritize the content and features to support primary goals. Learn more Full article: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Usability Heuristic #8) 3-minute video: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them. Example of Usability Heuristic #9: Wrong way signs on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction and ask them to stop. Tips Use traditional error-message visuals, like bold, red text. Tell users what went wrong in language they will understand — avoid technical jargon. Offer users a solution, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately. Learn more Full article: Error-Message Guidelines 2-minute video: Helping Users Overcome Errors 10: Help and Documentation It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out. Example of Usability Heuristic #10: Information kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers’ problems in context and immediately. Tips Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search . Whenever possible, present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it. List concrete steps to be carried out.

Note from Jakob I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b]. In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the 10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994. When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.

Judge its size. What you’re seeing is roughly the same size as the frame your mobile users have available to view your entire mobile site. And when it comes to the mobile checkout experience, you should fold that business card in half as the touch keyboard will take up close to 50% of the available screen space in portrait mode. If the user is in landscape mode the landscape keyboard will take up 70-80% of the screen. Throughout all our usability test sessions of mobile checkouts this extreme lack of page overview was observed to have severe implications on the user’s checkout experience and their ability to even complete a mobile purchase. Users simply get “lost in the page” – especially when filling out forms. Therefore, to account for this lack of visible context and page overview in your mobile checkout and payment design, closely consider the following 6 mobile checkout insights : 1) Fields Are Out of Context When users lose their overview of the page they often tend to focus on each form field as a separate isolated task to complete, and not so much a part of a large whole (as they more often do during the checkout process at desktop sites). It’s therefore critical that all the field labels can be read and understood when read out of context. For example, a label shouldn’t simply read “Phone”, even if placed within a “Billing Info” section header, but should instead be completely context-independent and read “Billing Phone”. This of course goes for any type of field, so it should similarly be “Gift Certificate Pin” instead of just “Enter Pin”, and so on. This way, the user can fill out the form field regardless of whether they remember its context (which is often out of view). 2) Account Selection Step More than half of the test subjects (60% to be exact) had serious trouble identifying, seeing and selecting the guest-checkout option at the account selection step during checkout. To simplify the initial page impression and set the right expectations of what the user should do at a given step, consider using the principles of progressive disclosure and dynamically collapse the content. For example, at the account selection step, instead of having 3 separate headers for “Sign-in”, “Create account” and “Guest checkout,” each with their respective fields shown, simply collapse all the content and show 3 clickable headers. This allows the user to instantly get a complete overview of all the available options (“there are three paths you can take, which direction would you like to follow, sir?”). A simple mock-up showing how all three account-selection options can be displayed in collapsed state (with guest checkout at the top), so that the user can instantly get an overview of all the available options. See further examples and explanation of the account-step issue in our guest post at Smashing Magazine, Exploring 10 Fundamental Aspects Of M-Commerce Usability (section #6). 3) Basic Mobile Form Usability The checkout process is dominated by form fields, so naturally any form field usability issues will tend to cause trouble during the checkout process. Some of the most severe issues that arose during testing were due to basic mobile form usability issues such as: a) Users not being able to see their typed input because the field label was placed to the left of the field, making the field itself too short. For this reason form field labels on mobile should always be placed above the field (except when in landscape mode), as outlined in Mobile Form Usability: Place Labels Above the Field . b) Users not being able to see the field’s context due to the use of inline labels. While inline labels look simple, they are in fact a perfect example of false simplicity : visually simple but complicated to use. The major usability issue is that the label disappears as the user begins typing (or in really poor implementations, as soon as the field receives focus, see first image), but the issues extend to validation errors (see second image) where users will often have to delete their input just to see the label again, as further described in Mobile Form Usability: Never Use Inline Labels . c) Users having to endure needlessly many field interactions due to inputs being split into multiple form fields. While the intention of wanting to indicate the desired input format is great, it ends up creating needless friction as it requires an inordinate amount of field interactions. Therefore, make sure you have just a single phone number field, zip code field, and a single “full name” field, as outlined in Mobile Form Usability: Avoid Splitting Single Input Entities . 4) Inline help “This CVV2, I have no idea what that is. On some sites there is a small help to click – but it’s not here. I think I would call my son and ask him.” Even with context-independent labels placed above the field, users may still become doubtful about certain fields if a set of basic questions aren’t answered. These doubts range from the very severe “What is being asked for?” (seen above), to privacy concerns “Why do you need it?” , to input formatting “How should I format the input?” . Unclear field labels remain one of the most important aspects of both mobile and desktop checkout form usability, alas, it is also one of the most neglected facets with 92% of top 100 desktop e-commerce sites still having room for improvement. For the 15+ most common pitfalls see Add Descriptions To Checkout Form Labels (92% Get It Wrong) . Furthermore, in a mobile checkout, any descriptions, help and field clarifications, must be placed exactly where the doubt is likely to occur. Instructions placed at the top of the page proved to be of little value during testing as the subjects simply overlooked it (again due to the extreme lack of overview described in the introduction). This makes inline help such as click-based tooltips and form field descriptions vital. 5) Optimize For Touch Keyboards Form usability can be greatly improved by leveraging the various input-optimized touch keyboards available (e-mail, phone, etc). Yet, of the top 50 mobile optimized e-commerce sites, 60% fail to utilize 2 of 5 keyboard optimizations. During our usability testing, this resulted in checkout experiences dominated by validation errors, and even orders submitted with erroneous data. At HP, ‘str’ is auto-(in)corrected to ‘ate’ because they haven’t disabled auto-correction. At Amazon, the standard alphanumeric keyboard is displayed instead of the phone-optimized keyboard. Using these touch keyboards is technically very simple – the difficult part can be to identify all of the candidate fields across a large website. We’ve made a Touch Keyboard Cheat Sheet showing how to set the best combination of keyboard type , inputmode , autocorrect=\"off\" , autocapitalize=\"off\" and novalidate for checkout fields such as name, phone, credit card number, address, e-mail, etc. (it also includes a touch keyboard benchmark of the top 50 mobile commerce sites). 6) Auto-detect as much data as possible Typing on the small touch keyboard is both slow and very prone to errors. So whenever technically possible, auto-detect and auto-complete as much as you can. For country selection this can be IP geo-targeting or at the very least an intelligent country auto-complete . “This is the sort of thing I really like. Now we’re talking. I don’t know how they did it, but I’m glad they are giving me the option of selecting ‘Houston’ rather than typing it,” a subject rejoiced during checkout at 1-800-Flowers (he had submitted his zip code at an earlier page and 1-800-Flowers used this to suggest a city and auto-select his state) Things like state and city name can often be auto-detected based on the user’s ZIP-code, so simply ask for user’s ZIP code first and then pre-fill the state and city fields. Luckily there are two freely available plugin’s for just this: Ziptastic and Zippopotam.us Mobile Checkouts When designing a mobile checkout think back on that business card. Your users will have to go through a number of pages and fill out a bunch of form fields all within that tiny area, and they typically have the touch keyboard open which cuts the available screen real estate in half! These 6 recommendations are a good place to start in order to deal with this extreme lack of page overview that your users suffer under during the mobile checkout process. When you have a decent mobile checkout design up and running be sure to test it extensively internally, but also externally, preferably on users within the target audience, using their own device in a realistic context (e.g. at home on the couch). This allows you to uncover issues related to site, audience and context, which are hard to uncover otherwise.

WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. A different page introduces WCAG 3 . WCAG is not an introduction to accessibility. For introductions, see Accessibility Fundamentals Overview . Quick links to resources: How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) WCAG 2.2 Standard , What’s New in WCAG 2.2 WCAG 2.1 Standard Page Contents Introduction Who WCAG is for What is in WCAG 2 WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 Translations ISO/IEC 40500, EAA, EN 301 549 Who develops WCAG More about WCAG Introduction Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. Who WCAG is for WCAG is for those who want a technical standard. It is not an introduction to accessibility. For links to introductory material, see “Where should I start?” in the FAQ . WCAG is primarily intended for: Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.) Web authoring tool developers Web accessibility evaluation tool developers Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility To meet the needs of others — including policy makers, managers, and researchers — there are many different WAI Resources . What is in WCAG 2 The WCAG 2.2 has 13 guidelines. The guidelines are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust . For each guideline, there are testable success criteria . The success criteria are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA . The success criteria are what determine “conformance” to WCAG. That is, in order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria. Details are in the Conformance section of WCAG . For a short summary of the WCAG 2 guidelines, see WCAG 2 at a Glance . Supporting material and supplemental guidance The following resources help you understand and implement WCAG, and improve accessibility beyond WCAG: Quick Reference / How to Meet WCAG 2 / Checklist Understanding WCAG 2 Techniques for WCAG 2 Test Rules for WCAG 2 Supplemental Guidance Please read about these WCAG 2 resources from WCAG 2 Documents . WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards are referenceable when they are published as a ‘W3C Recommendation’ web standard. WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018, and updates were published on 21 September 2023, 12 December 2024, and 6 May 2025. WCAG 2.2 was published on 5 October 2023, and an update was published on 12 December 2024. For information on the updates, see the WCAG 2 FAQ . WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 are designed to be “backwards compatible”, which means content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. If you want to meet all the versions, you can use the WCAG 2.2 resources and you don’t need to bother looking at earlier versions. All the success criteria from 2.0 are included in 2.1, and all from 2.1 are in 2.2 (except 4.1.1, explained in the next paragraph). WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines. WCAG 2.1 adds 1 guideline and 17 success criteria. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1 . WCAG 2.2 adds 9 success criteria. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.2 . A few things have changed, and we intend the updates in the related documents to support backwards compatibility in practice. The main change is that in WCAG 2.2, one success criteria (4.1.1 Parsing) is obsolete. Notes added to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0 errata address this, as explained in WCAG 2 FAQ, 4.1.1 Parsing . WCAG 2.2 also includes Notes about different languages; more information is in WCAG 2 FAQ, internationalization . WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.2 are all existing standards. WCAG 2.2 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the latest version of WCAG. Translations Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of WCAG 2 are listed in WCAG 2 Translations . ISO/IEC 40500, EAA, EN 301 549 WCAG 2.2 is an approved International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2025 , and is available free from ISO. ISO/IEC 40500:2025 is exactly the same as the October 2023 version of WCAG 2.2. We expect the December 2024 version of WCAG 2.2 to be available as ISO/IEC 40500:2026 by late 2026. In addressing the European Accessibility Act (EAA), most organizations use WCAG and the European Standard EN 301 549: Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services. EN 301 549 currently uses WCAG 2.1. We expect the next version of EN 301 549 to use the latest version of WCAG 2.2. To find how laws around the world use WCAG, see Web Accessibility Laws &amp; Policies . W3C encourages you to use the latest version of WCAG. Content that meets WCAG 2.2 also meets WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. Who develops WCAG The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ( AG WG ) (formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group) , which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) Web Accessibility Initiative ( WAI ). WAI updates Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 periodically. We welcome comments and submission of new techniques . Opportunities for contributing to WCAG and other WAI work are introduced in Participating in WAI . More about WCAG WCAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Essential Components of Web Accessibility explains the relationship between the different guidelines.

Learn more about WebAIM Evaluation Services Important! The following is NOT the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2. It is a checklist that presents our recommendations for implementing the most common accessibility principles and techniques for those seeking WCAG conformance. The language used here significantly simplifies and condenses the official WCAG 2.2 specification and supporting materials to make it easier to implement and verify for web pages. The checklist contains links to the official success criteria. A PDF version of this checklist is also available Tools Show success criteria from WCAG version... 2.0 2.1 2.2 Show level... A AA AAA Perceivable Web content is made available to the senses - sight, hearing, and/or touch Guideline 1.1 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content 1.1.1 Non-text Content A 2.0 Images, image buttons, and image map hot spots have appropriate, equivalent alternative text . Images that do not convey content, are decorative, or contain content that is already conveyed in text are given empty alternative text ( alt=&quot;&quot; ) or implemented as CSS backgrounds. All linked images have descriptive alternative text. Equivalent alternatives to complex images are provided in context or on a separate linked page. Form buttons have a descriptive value. Inputs have associated accessible names . Embedded multimedia is identified via accessible text. Frames and iframes are appropriately titled . Guideline 1.2 Provide alternatives for time-based media. NOTE: If the audio or video is designated as an alternative to web content (e.g., an audio or sign language version of a web page), then the web content itself serves as the alternative. 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) A 2.0 A descriptive transcript of relevant content is provided for non-live audio-only (audio podcasts, MP3 files, etc.). A descriptive transcript or audio description of relevant content is provided for non-live video-only, unless the video is decorative. 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) A 2.0 Synchronized captions are provided for non-live video (YouTube videos, etc.). 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) A 2.0 A descriptive transcript or audio description is provided for non-live video. NOTE: Only required if there is relevant visual content that is not presented in the audio. 1.2.4 Captions (Live) AA 2.0 Synchronized captions are provided for live media that contains audio (audio-only broadcasts, web casts, video conferences, etc.) 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) AA 2.0 Audio descriptions are provided for non-live video. NOTE: Only required if there is relevant visual content that is not presented in the audio. While not required at Level AA, for optimal accessibility WebAIM recommends descriptive transcripts in addition to audio descriptions. 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) AAA 2.0 A sign language video is provided for media that contains audio. 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) AAA 2.0 When audio description cannot be added to video due to insufficient pauses in the audio, an alternative version of the video with pauses that allow audio descriptions is provided. 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) AAA 2.0 A descriptive transcript is provided for pre-recorded media that has a video track. For optimal accessibility, WebAIM strongly recommends transcripts for all multimedia. 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) AAA 2.0 A descriptive text transcript (e.g., the script of the live audio) is provided for live content that has audio. Guideline 1.3 Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships A 2.0 Semantic markup is appropriately used to designate headings, regions/landmarks, lists, emphasized or special text, etc. Tables are used for tabular data and data cells are associated with their headers. Data table captions, if present, are associated to data tables. Text labels are associated with form inputs. Related form controls are grouped with fieldset/legend. ARIA labelling may be used when standard HTML is insufficient. 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence A 2.0 The reading and navigation order (determined by code order) is logical and intuitive. 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics A 2.0 Instructions do not rely upon shape, size, or visual location (e.g., &quot;Click the square icon to continue&quot; or &quot;Instructions are in the right-hand column&quot;). Instructions do not rely upon sound (e.g., &quot;A beeping sound indicates you may continue.&quot;). 1.3.4 Orientation AA 2.1 Orientation of web content is not restricted to only portrait or landscape, unless a specific orientation is necessary. 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose AA 2.1 Input fields that collect certain types of user information have an appropriate autocomplete attribute defined. 1.3.6 Identify Purpose AAA 2.1 Regions/landmarks are used to identify page regions. ARIA is used, where appropriate, to enhance HTML semantics to better identify the purpose of interface components. Guideline 1.4 Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. 1.4.1 Use of Color A 2.0 Color is not used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elements. Color alone is not used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless the contrast ratio between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 and an additional distinction (e.g., it becomes underlined) is provided when the link is hovered over and receives keyboard focus. 1.4.2 Audio Control A 2.0 A mechanism is provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust volume for audio that automatically plays on a page for more than 3 seconds. 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) AA 2.0 Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Large text - at least 18 point (typically 24px) or 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold - has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. 1.4.4 Resize text AA 2.0 The page is readable and functional when the page is zoomed to 200%. NOTE: 1.4.10 (below) introduces additional requirements for zoomed content. 1.4.5 Images of Text AA 2.0 If the same visual presentation can be made using text alone, an image is not used to present that text. 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) AAA 2.0 Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. Large text - at least 18 point (typically 24px) or 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold - has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio AAA 2.0 Audio with speech has no or very low background noise so the speech is easily distinguished. 1.4.8 Visual Presentation AAA 2.0 Blocks of text over one sentence in length: Are no more than 80 characters wide. Are NOT fully justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). Have adequate line spacing (at least 1/2 the height of the text) and paragraph spacing (1.5 times line spacing). Have defined or inherited foreground and background colors. Do NOT require horizontal scrolling when the text size is doubled. 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) AAA 2.0 Text is used within an image only for decoration (the image does not convey content) OR when the information cannot be presented with text alone. 1.4.10 Reflow AA 2.1 No loss of content or functionality occurs, and horizontal scrolling is avoided when content is presented at a width of 320 pixels. This requires responsive design for most web sites. This is best tested by setting the browser window to 1280 pixels wide and then zooming the page content to 400%. Content that requires horizontal scrolling, such as data tables, complex images (such as maps and charts), toolbars, etc. are exempted. 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast AA 2.1 A contrast ratio of at least 3:1 is present for differentiating graphical objects (such as icons and components of charts or graphs) and author-customized interface components (such as buttons, form controls, and focus indicators/outlines). At least 3:1 contrast is maintained in the various states (focus, hover, active, etc.) of author-customized interactive components. 1.4.12 Text Spacing AA 2.1 No loss of content or functionality occurs when the user adapts paragraph spacing to 2 times the font size, text line height/spacing to 1.5 times the font size, word spacing to .16 times the font size, and letter spacing to .12 times the font size. This is best supported by avoiding pixel height definitions for elements that contain text. 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus AA 2.1 When additional content is presented on hover or keyboard focus: The newly revealed content can be dismissed (generally via the Esc key) without moving the pointer or keyboard focus, unless the content presents an input error or does not obscure or interfere with other page content. The pointer can be moved to the new content without the content disappearing. The new content must remain visible until the pointer or keyboard focus is moved away from the triggering control, the new content is dismissed, or the new content is no longer relevant. Operable Interface forms, controls, and navigation are operable. Guideline 2.1 Make all functionality available from a keyboard. 2.1.1 Keyboard A 2.0 All page functionality is available using the keyboard , unless the functionality cannot be accomplished in any known way using a keyboard (e.g., free hand drawing). Page-specified shortcut keys and accesskeys (accesskey should typically be avoided) do not conflict with existing browser and screen reader shortcuts. 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap A 2.0 Keyboard focus is never locked or trapped at one particular page element. The user can navigate to and from all navigable page elements using only a keyboard. 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) AAA 2.0 All page functionality is available using the keyboard. 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts A 2.1 If a keyboard shortcut uses printable character keys, then the user must be able to disable the key command, change the defined key to a non-printable key (Ctrl, Alt, etc.), or only activate the shortcut when an associated interface component or button is focused. Guideline 2.2 Provide users enough time to read and use content. 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable A 2.0 If a page or application has a time limit, the user is given options to turn off, adjust, or extend that time limit. This is not a requirement for real-time events (e.g., an auction), where the time limit is absolutely required, or if the time limit is longer than 20 hours. 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide A 2.0 Automatically moving, blinking, or scrolling content (such as carousels, marquees, or animations) that lasts longer than 5 seconds can be paused, stopped, or hidden by the user. Automatically updating content (e.g., a dynamically-updating news ticker, chat messages, etc.) can be paused, stopped, or hidden by the user or the user can manually control the timing of the updates. 2.2.3 No Timing AAA 2.0 The content and functionality have no time limits or constraints. 2.2.4 Interruptions AAA 2.0 Interruptions (alerts, page updates, etc.) can be postponed or suppressed by the user. 2.2.5 Re-authenticating AAA 2.0 If an authentication session expires, the user can re-authenticate and continue the activity without losing any data from the current page. 2.2.6 Timeouts AAA 2.1 Users must be warned of any timeout that could result in data loss, unless the data is preserved for longer than 20 hours of user inactivity. Guideline 2.3 Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures. 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold A 2.0 No page content flashes more than 3 times per second unless that flashing content is sufficiently small and the flashes are of low contrast and do not contain too much red. ( See general flash and red flash thresholds ) 2.3.2 Three Flashes AAA 2.0 No page content flashes more than 3 times per second. 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions AAA 2.1 Users can disable non-essential animation and movement that is triggered by user interaction. Guideline 2.4 Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks A 2.0 A link is provided to skip navigation and other page elements that are repeated across web pages. While proper use of headings or regions/landmarks is sufficient to meet this success criterion, because keyboard navigation by headings or regions is not supported in most browsers, WebAIM recommends a &quot;skip&quot; link in addition to headings and regions. 2.4.2 Page Titled A 2.0 The web page has a descriptive and informative page title . 2.4.3 Focus Order A 2.0 The navigation order of links, form controls, etc. is logical and intuitive. 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) A 2.0 The purpose of each link (or image button or image map hotspot) can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text and its context (e.g., surrounding text, list item, previous heading, or table headers). Links with the same text that go to different locations are readily distinguishable. 2.4.5 Multiple Ways AA 2.0 Multiple ways are available to find other web pages on the site - at least two of: a list of related pages, table of contents, site map, site search, or list of all available web pages. 2.4.6 Headings and Labels AA 2.0 Page headings and labels for form and interactive controls are informative. Avoid duplicating heading and label text unless the structure provides adequate differentiation between them. 2.4.7 Focus Visible AA 2.0 There is a visible indicator for page elements when they receive keyboard focus. 2.4.8 Location AAA 2.0 If a web page is part of a sequence of pages or within a complex site structure, an indication of the current page location is provided, for example, through breadcrumbs or specifying the current step in a sequence (e.g., &quot;Step 2 of 5 - Shipping Address&quot;). 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) AAA 2.0 The purpose of each link (or image button or image map hotspot) can be determined from the link text alone. There are no links with the same text that go to different locations. 2.4.10 Section Headings AAA 2.0 Beyond providing an overall document structure, individual sections of content are designated using headings, where appropriate. 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) AA 2.2 When elements have keyboard focus, they are not entirely covered or hidden by page content. 2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) AAA 2.2 When elements have keyboard focus, they are entirely visible. 2.4.13 Focus Appearance AAA 2.2 If a custom focus indicator or background color is in place, the focus indicator pixels must: have at least 3:1 contrast between focused/unfocused states be at least as large as the area of a 2 pixel thick perimeter surrounding the element. The formula (width &times; 4) + (height &times; 4) = focus indicator area can be used for rectangular components. Guideline 2.5 Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard. 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures A 2.1 If multipoint or path-based gestures (such as pinching, swiping, or dragging across the screen) are not essential to the functionality, then the functionality can also be performed with a single point activation (such as activating a button). 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation A 2.1 To help avoid inadvertent activation of controls, avoid non-essential down-event (e.g., onmousedown ) activation when clicking, tapping, or long pressing the screen. For complex interactions (such as drag and drop), onmousedown can be used if an associated onmouseup (or similar) event can be aborted or reversed. 2.5.3 Label in Name A 2.1 If an interface component (link, button, etc.) presents text (or images of text), the accessible name (label, alternative text, aria-label, etc.) for that component must include the visible text. 2.5.4 Motion Actuation A 2.1 Functionality that is triggered by moving the device (such as shaking or panning a mobile device) or by user movement (such as waving to a camera) can be disabled and equivalent functionality is provided via standard controls like buttons. 2.5.5 Target Size AAA 2.1 Clickable targets are at least 44 by 44 pixels in size unless an alternative target of that size is provided, the target is inline (such as a link within a sentence), the target is not author-modified (such as a default checkbox), or the small target size is essential to the functionality. 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms AAA 2.1 Content does not require a specific input type, such as touch-only or keyboard-only, but must support alternative inputs (such as using a keyboard on a mobile device). 2.5.7 Dragging Movements AA 2.2 Functionality that uses pointer dragging can also be achieved using a single pointer without dragging (unless dragging is essential). 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) AA 2.2 Pointer input target sizes are at least 24 by 24 pixels unless: A 24 pixel diameter circle centered on the target element does not intersect with any other target or a 24 pixel circle centered on an adjacent target. The functionality can be achieved in some other conformant manner. The target is in a sentence or list. The target size can't be modified or is essential to the functionality. Understandable Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. Guideline 3.1 Make text content readable and understandable. 3.1.1 Language of Page A 2.0 The language of the page is identified using the lang attribute (e.g., &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; ). 3.1.2 Language of Parts AA 2.0 The language of page content that is in a different language is identified using the lang attribute (e.g., &lt;blockquote lang=&quot;es&quot;&gt; ). 3.1.3 Unusual Words AAA 2.0 Words that may be ambiguous, unfamiliar, or used in a very specific way are defined through adjacent text, a definition list, a glossary, or other suitable method. 3.1.4 Abbreviations AAA 2.0 The meaning of an unfamiliar abbreviation is provided by expanding it the first time it is used, using the &lt;abbr&gt; element, or linking to a definition or glossary. 3.1.5 Reading Level AAA 2.0 A more understandable alternative is provided for content that is more advanced than can be reasonably read by a person with roughly 9 years of primary education. 3.1.6 Pronunciation AAA 2.0 If the pronunciation of a word is vital to understanding that word, its pronunciation is provided immediately following the word or via a link or glossary. Guideline 3.2 Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways. 3.2.1 On Focus A 2.0 When a page element receives focus, it does not result in a substantial change to the page, the spawning of a pop-up window, an additional change of keyboard focus, or any other change that could confuse or disorient the user. 3.2.2 On Input A 2.0 When a user inputs information or interacts with a control, it does not result in a substantial change to the page, the spawning of a pop-up window, an additional change of keyboard focus, or any other change that could confuse or disorient the user unless the user is informed of the change ahead of time. 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation AA 2.0 Navigation links that are repeated on web pages do not change order when navigating through the site. 3.2.4 Consistent Identification AA 2.0 Elements that have the same functionality across multiple web pages are consistently identified. For example, a search box at the top of the site should always be labeled the same way. 3.2.5 Change on Request AAA 2.0 Substantial changes to the page, the spawning of pop-up windows, uncontrolled changes of keyboard focus, or any other change that could confuse or disorient the user must be initiated by the user. Alternatively, the user is provided an option to disable such changes. 3.2.6 Consistent Help A 2.2 Contact and self-help details or functionality are presented consistently when present on multiple web pages. Guideline 3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes. 3.3.1 Error Identification A 2.0 Required inputs or inputs that require a specific format, value, or length provide this information within the element's label. Form validation errors are efficient, intuitive, and accessible. The error is clearly identified, quick access to the problematic element is provided, and the user can easily fix the error and resubmit the form. 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions A 2.0 Inputs are identified by labels or instructions that help users know what information to enter. 3.3.3 Error Suggestion AA 2.0 If an input error is detected (via client-side or server-side validation), suggestions are provided for fixing the input in a timely and accessible manner. 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) AA 2.0 Submissions, changes, and deletions of legal, financial, or test data can be reversed, verified, or confirmed. 3.3.5 Help AAA 2.0 Instructions and cues are provided in context to help in form completion and submission. 3.3.6 Error Prevention (All) AAA 2.0 If the user can submit information, the submission is reversible, verified, or confirmed. 3.3.7 Redundant Entry A 2.2 Information that a user must re-enter to complete a single-session process must be auto-populated or available for the user to select, unless re-entering the information is essential to the functionality, the information poses security issues, or the previously-entered information is no longer valid. 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) AA 2.2 A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless the cognitive function test can be bypassed in some way, can be completed with assistance by some other mechanism, uses object recognition (such as \"click on the photo of a flower\"), or uses identification of non-text content provided by the user (such as a user-provided image). 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) AAA 2.2 A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless the cognitive function test can be bypassed in some way or can be completed with assistance by some other mechanism. Robust Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Guideline 4.1 Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. 4.1.1 Parsing (Obsolete and removed) A 2.0 NOTE: This success criterion is no longer useful and as of 2023 has been removed from WCAG. It previously required that significant HTML validation/parsing errors be avoided. 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value A 2.0 Markup is used in a way that facilitates accessibility. This includes following the HTML specifications and using forms, input labels, frame titles, etc. appropriately. ARIA is used appropriately to enhance accessibility when HTML is not sufficient. 4.1.3 Status Messages AA 2.1 If an important status message is presented and focus is not set to that message, the message must be announced to screen reader users, typically via an ARIA alert or live region.

They are typically used for actions with irreversible consequences, such as closing an account, deleting files, or removing personnel records from a database. Destructive buttons usually have the labels \"Delete,\" \"Remove,\" or \"Cancel.\" Poorly designed destructive buttons can lead to significant data loss, frustrate users, and negatively impact user experience and your organization's reputation. When adding buttons to your website, use the &lt;button&gt; HTML element , which is \"an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology.\" &#126; &lt;button&gt;: The Button element Remember, HTML buttons inherit the default style of the user's operating system, but their appearance can be customized using CSS. Let's examine best practices and WCAG guidelines to design destructive buttons that are both accessible and minimize the risk of unintended actions. Common Design Pitfalls &amp; How to Avoid Them Misleading Labels Buttons with ambiguous or misleading labels. For example, a button that reads \"Proceed\" but actually deletes data when activated. Correct Misleading Labels - Use strong, unambiguous labels like \"Delete Account\" and \"Cancel Subscription.\"&#160; Like link text, button labels should be descriptive and self-explanatory, clearly indicating their purpose and intended action. Lack of Confirmation Buttons that perform actions without requiring user verification or confirmation dialog. Add Safety Check and Confirmation Dialog - Ask the user to confirm their intention before allowing them to proceed with the destructive action. Inform them of what the consequences will be if they proceed. For example, tell the user, \"Closing your account will delete all your data, and you will lose access to all account features. Are you certain you want to proceed?\" Provide response buttons that are clear and succinct, such as \"Cancel\" and \"Confirm.\" Once the destructive button has been activated and the requested process has been completed, provide a brief, easily understandable confirmation. Include concise, easy-to-find contact information to help users with additional questions, concerns, or regrets. Poor Visual Cues Buttons that do not clearly indicate that they are clickable and fail to visually differentiate between the destructive and non-destructive buttons. Check Color Choice, Target Size, Color Contrast, Focus and Fonts: &#160; Color Choice - The most common color choice for destructive buttons is red. However, for people with certain forms of colorblindness, red is non-distinguishable. No matter the color you choose for your destructive button, you should also include a strong, unambiguous label and even a representative icon, if appropriate, directly on the button that clearly and concisely states the button's purpose. For example, Target Size - Destructive and non-destructive buttons should have a minimum target size of 24 X 24 CSS pixels or be \"positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target..\" This requirement is defined in WCAG SC 2.5.8: Target Size (Minimum) (Level AA) . \"Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.\" Color Contrast&#8212;To ensure your destructive and non-destructive buttons are visible to users with low vision, mobile users, and /&#160; or &#160;those in bright light conditions, ensure the button color and text color meet the minimum color contrast requirement of 4.5:1 set forth by&#160; WCAG SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA) . According to WCAG SC 2.4.7: Focus Visible (Level AA), users must be able to determine which interactive element has focus. To accomplish this, destructive and non-destructive buttons must have a clearly visible indicator to show when they have focus, and the focus indicator must have sufficient color contrast with both the button color and the background color. You must test to ensure focus is visible as some user agents may not always show a focus indicator or only show focus when the keyboard is used and neglect to show focus on mouseover. Appearance and positioning are significant when providing a control that supports \"destructive\" actions. (See Harvard University's examples in the article titled \" Techniques: Differentiating Controls \") Despite their ominous-sounding title, destructive buttons serve a useful purpose. However, we must be diligent in designing destructive buttons that are not only accessible but also clearly state their purpose and the consequences of activating them.

They are called &quot;heuristics&quot; because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. Thank you to Kelley Gordon for designing the visuals and posters included in this article. Thank you to Kate Moran and Feifei Liu for updating the heuristic names, descriptions, and examples. In This Article: 1: Visibility of System Status 2: Match Between the System and the Real World 3: User Control and Freedom 4: Consistency and Standards 5: Error Prevention 6: Recognition Rather than Recall 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors 10: Help and Documentation Free 10 Heuristics Poster 1: Visibility of System Status The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand. Example of Usability Heuristic #1: You Are Here indicators on mall maps show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next. Tips Communicate clearly to users what the system’s state is — no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them. Present feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately). Build trust through open and continuous communication . Learn more Full article: Visibility of System Status 3-minute video about the Visibility Heuristic 2: Match Between the System and the Real World The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users. When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping ), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive. Example of Usability Heuristic #2: When stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to which heating element. Tips Ensure that users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word’s definition. Never assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that of your users. User research will uncover your users' familiar terminology, as well as their mental models around important concepts. Learn more Full article: Match Between the System and the Real World 2-minute video: Match Between the System and the Real World 3: User Control and Freedom Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process. When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated. Example of Usability Heuristic #3: Digital spaces need quick emergency exits, just like physical spaces do. Tips Support Undo and Redo . Show a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a Cancel button . Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable. Learn more Full article: User Control and Freedom 2-minute video: User Control and Freedom 4: Consistency and Standards Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions. Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours . Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new. Example of Usability Heuristic #4: Checkin counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers’ expectations. Tips Improve learnability by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external. Maintain consistency within a single product or a family of products (internal consistency). Follow established industry conventions (external consistency). Learn more Full article: Consistency and Standards 3-minute video: Consistency and Standards 5: Error Prevention Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. There are two types of errors: slips and mistakes . Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design. Example of Usability Heuristic #5: ​​​​ Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs. Tips Prioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations. Avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults . Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and warning your users . Learn more Full article: Preventing User Errors 3-minute video: Error Prevention 6: Recognition Rather than Recall Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. Humans have limited short-term memories . Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users. Example of Usability Heuristic #6: It’s easier for most people to recognize the capitals of countries, instead of having to remember them. People are more likely to correctly answer the question Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal? rather than What’s the capital of Portugal? Tips Let people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (“recall”) it. Offer help in context , instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize. Reduce the information that users have to remember. Learn more Full article: Recognition vs. Recall in UX 3-minute video: Recognition vs. Recall 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them. Example of Usability Heuristic #7: Regular routes are listed on maps, but locals with knowledge of the area can take shortcuts. Tips Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures. Provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users. Allow for customization , so users can make selections about how they want the product to work. Learn more Full article: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: The 7th Usability Heuristic Explained 3-minute video: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals. Example of Usability Heuristic #8: ​​​​​​ An ornate teapot may have excessive decorative elements, like an uncomfortable handle or hard-to-wash nozzle, that can interfere with usability. Tips Keep the content and visual design of UI focused on the essentials. Don't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need. Prioritize the content and features to support primary goals. Learn more Full article: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Usability Heuristic #8) 3-minute video: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them. Example of Usability Heuristic #9: Wrong way signs on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction and ask them to stop. Tips Use traditional error-message visuals, like bold, red text. Tell users what went wrong in language they will understand — avoid technical jargon. Offer users a solution, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately. Learn more Full article: Error-Message Guidelines 2-minute video: Helping Users Overcome Errors 10: Help and Documentation It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out. Example of Usability Heuristic #10: Information kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers’ problems in context and immediately. Tips Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search . Whenever possible, present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it. List concrete steps to be carried out.

Note from Jakob I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b]. In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the 10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994. When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.

Design for messy situations like name changes, shared accounts, and bad actors from day one. Let's talk about something uncomfortable. You know that beautiful user flow you mapped out? The one where everything works perfectly? That one that works great for most of your users most of the time. The problem, of course, is the users it doesn’t work for. They're stuck dealing with divorced parents sharing custody calendars, trying to access their accounts after their phone got stolen in Barcelona, or attempting to use your app while their internet cuts out every few minutes because they live in rural Montana. In This Article: Edge Cases Are Tough The Cases We Don't Think About The Cases We Don't Want to Think About The Technical Realities We Avoid Accessibility as an Afterthought Stop Designing for Perfect People Edge Cases Are Tough These are all examples of edge cases. An edge case is a rare or unexpected scenario that typically involves unusual user inputs, extreme data values, or uncommon usage patterns that weren't anticipated during the primary design and testing phases. Sometimes the rarest of them will be called corner cases. Not every deviation from the happy path is that unusual, though. Some things we think of as exceptions are surprisingly common. Almost every one of your users will run into at least one of the following problems at some point, if they stick around long enough. The Cases We Don't Think About When edge cases fall through the cracks in our designs, it’s often because they’re scenarios designers would rather not consider. Name Changes The Scenario Someone gets married, divorced, or transitions. Simple, right? Just change the name field. Except now their old name is baked into URLs, email notifications still use the old name, and other users can't find them because search works only with the original name. While a name change might not be an everyday occurrence for any given individual, it happens to somebody somewhere every day, and it should be easy for that person to handle it on their own, without having to jump through hoops. Design Better Make names editable and reflect those changes everywhere in the product – even in URLs. Plan for gradual rollouts where both names work, at least temporarily, by default. For example, if somebody’s email changes, have the old address forward to the new one, or if somebody needs to be found in a directory, have the old name redirect to the new. Don’t be too strict on name-validation fields. If somebody wants to present themselves as “Pat NewName (formerly OldName),” you should allow that. This approach also has the benefit of not annoying people who have spaces or punctuation in their names, which is very common in many parts of the world. Consider that some users need their old names completely scrubbed for safety reasons. This may mean allowing the user to override the previous suggestion to make both names searchable! Both use cases are perfectly valid, and giving the user control over how they are presented to the world is always a good choice. Account Lockouts The Scenario An email account gets hacked. A phone falls in the toilet. An authentication app gets corrupted. Your user is now permanently locked out of their account with three years of work inside it, and your Contact support form requires them to be logged in to access it. Design Better Have multiple account-recovery options that don't all depend on the same device. Make your support-contact information findable and usable when someone isn't logged in. Multiple Accounts The Scenario Your user has a work account and a personal account, or maybe they're a freelancer with separate accounts for each client. Your product treats this situation like they're trying to game the system instead of recognizing it as a completely normal use case. Design Better Account switching should be trivial. Don’t make people log out and back in every single time they want to change. In some cases, you can let people sign in once and then create multiple subaccounts or just associate multiple accounts with the same login information. For example, if a user has a work account and a personal account on a social media site or a teleconferencing app, they shouldn’t have to manage everything separately. For bonus points, allow users to share global settings across all their accounts . Users shouldn’t have to upload their profile picture or set their preferences multiple times if they don’t want to. On the other hand, don’t require any shared settings. There are lots of great reasons to have different settings for work accounts and personal accounts. Very few people want to sign into their work Zoom and have all their coworkers see their character name and avatar from their weekly Dungeons and Dragons session. Shared Accounts The Scenario While your beautiful user model probably focuses on individuals, real people share accounts. Couples share streaming services. Families share photo storage. Sometimes one partner goes on a work trip, so both people will be using a product or service at the same time from different locations. Not everybody is doing this to avoid paying you extra fees. Sometimes it just makes sense to have linked accounts. Many family plans allow people to track their movies or music separately depending on who is using the device. That way they don’t end up getting recommendations to watch a Disney movie on date night or a horror flick when they’re watching with the kids. If your product is likely to be used on a shared device like a television or an iPad, give users profiles and let them decide who the user really is. Design Better Acknowledge shared accounts exist. Build features for legitimate account sharing like separate profiles and child safety features. Make it clear when sharing might be problematic for security without being punitive. Make it possible for people to disentangle their profiles and make separate accounts for perfectly normal reasons like break ups or kids going off to college, so they don’t lose all their data. The Cases We Don't Want to Think About Bad Actors The Scenario Someone's angry ex is harassing them through your platform. Trolls are gaming your community features to abuse other users. Your reporting system requires users to relive their trauma by documenting everything in detail, and even when bad actors are kicked out, they just make a new account and are back in no time. This can happen anywhere, even your enterprise product meant only to be used by teams at work. We want to believe that everyone using our products is going to be a good citizen and treat others with respect and empathy. Unfortunately, over 40 years of electronic communication through bulletin boards, instant-messaging systems, and social media (plus thousands of years of…you know…observing humanity) have proven this is very much not the case! Scammers, grifters, and griefers will constantly test your systems for vulnerabilities and use your products in ways you might personally find horrifying. The truth is that we’ve been building digital, connected products for far too long for you to pretend not to know this is coming. If you don’t design to prevent harassment and intentionally harmful misuse, users will assume you simply don’t care about the people being hurt. Design Better Build safety features from the ground up, not only as a response to problems. Make blocking and reporting easy and effective. Introduce some friction in account creation to make it difficult for people to automate abusive behaviors through infinite sock-puppet accounts. Test your trust and safety guidelines by actively considering the worst-case scenarios. Don’t forget to do research, or even better, codesign, with folks who have experienced this sort of harassment. A Deceased User The Scenario Death is the ultimate edge case nobody wants to design for. Your user's spouse dies, and suddenly they can't access the shared photo account because it was tied to their partner's email. Or worse — every time they open your app, they're confronted with notifications asking: Where's Mike? Invite him to collaborate! In some of the worst cases, users have been reminded of the deaths of loved ones by automatically created photo retrospectives or anniversary celebrations of posts on sites like Facebook. In this case, you not only need to plan for the eventual deaths of your users but also the deaths of anybody who is in any way a part of your system. If your users have taken pictures of a loved one, a friend, or a pet, those individuals might not always be around. An unexpected reminder of somebody who has passed away can be deeply traumatic, and you absolutely do not want your users to experience it on your platform when they’re trying to enjoy themselves. Design Better Build memorial or legacy modes for existing users that can persist in some way after they are gone, while still recognizing the fact that they are no longer alive. Let users designate trusted contacts to manage their digital legacies online. Do not send collaboration invites to inactive accounts after a reasonable period. Let people opt out of potentially sensitive email notifications around holidays or promotions. Do not autocreate “fun” retrospectives of images or posts that may include terrible memories, or, at least, let users easily opt out of them or designate certain pictures off limits. The Technical Realities We Avoid Unconsidered edge cases also happen when a use case feels too complex or messy from a technical perspective. Collaboration The Scenario Three people try to edit the same document. Two of them have slow internet, and one of them is on mobile. Your real-time collaboration feature becomes a real-time disaster with changes getting lost and confusion mounting. Or, even worse, you simply don’t have any collaboration features built into your system, so people end up emailing around files with ever expanding titles like Presentation_final_v3.5.key. Design Better Design for both asynchronous and real-time collaboration. Show clear conflict resolution. Make it obvious when someone's changes aren't saving. When there is a merge conflict between various edits, ask for guidance from the users. Enable change tracking and the ability to accept or reject changes. Data Exports The Scenario Your user wants to leave your platform. They've got three years of data they need to take with them. Your export feature generates a CSV that's missing half their information and is completely unusable in other tools. This one sometimes makes product managers roll their eyes a little. After all, who cares what happens if somebody is leaving the platform? They’re not your problem any longer if they’re not your user! It turns out that many governments care quite deeply! Not only is this good practice, but, in many jurisdictions, it’s also the law that people be able to take their data with them when they leave. Besides, just because your product isn’t right for a specific person doesn’t mean you want them telling other people how awful it was to leave your platform. Make it easy for folks to say nice things about you, even when they’re leaving, and make it an easy decision to come back some day when their needs change. Design Better Export should be a first-class feature, not an afterthought. Test your exports by importing them somewhere else. Consider formats that preserve relationships and metadata. Slow Connections The Scenario Your users travel or live in areas with spotty internet. They work in buildings with terrible WiFi. Sometimes they take the subway. Your app becomes a beautiful, useless loading screen whenever the connection drops. As somebody who spent several years riding BART into San Francisco and having 90% of the apps on my phone work sporadically, if at all, on my commute, I am begging you to do as much as possible to make things work, even without a perfect internet connection. Design Better Offline-first design isn't just for developing countries. Cache intelligently, and, whenever possible, provide some sort of off-line mode. Show clear indicators of sync status. Let users work locally and sync later. Accessibility as an Afterthought Accessibility, while much larger than an individual edge case, is a chronic problem for digital design. And it gets overlooked for similar reasons — it can feel difficult or uncomfortable to consider. Your product works great if you can see perfectly, hear clearly, and use both hands to navigate with precision. For everyone else, it's a frustrating barrier to getting things done. And that “everyone else” is not a small number! Did you know that, according to the CDC, more than 1 in 4 adults in the United States have some type of disability? At some point in our lives, most of us will have to deal with failing eyesight, hearing, or mobility. Obviously, there are a lot of great resources on how to design better for all of the different accessibility requirements. We can’t provide an exhaustive list of dos and don’ts in this article, but be sure to remember that accessibility isn’t a feature to add later. It’s a design constraint to embrace and plan for from day one. Learn how to build accessible products and test them with real assistive technologies and actual users! Stop Designing for Perfect People There are no perfect users living perfect lives with perfect internet connections and perfect intentions. The sooner we design for the messy, complicated (sometimes heartbreaking) reality of how people actually live, the better our products will serve everyone. Your \"edge cases\" aren't always edge cases. They're Tuesday afternoon for a good percentage of your users. The next time you're mapping out user flows or making decisions about new features, ask yourself: What happens when this goes wrong? What happens when life gets complicated? What happens when this feature encounters the chaos of real human existence? Then design for that too.

This article provides guidance for designing empty-state dialogues for content-less containers. At times, users will encounter empty states within an application: containers, screens, or panels for which content does not yet exist or otherwise cannot be displayed. Especially in complex applications that have not been fully configured by the user, empty states are quite common during onboarding and initial usage. Some typical scenarios when users might encounter empty states within an application are: When a user has not designated any items as favorites or has not opened any files yet, containers meant to display lists of favorited or recently viewed items will be empty. When an application supports alerts , but a user has not yet configured any alerts, there may be an empty pane or dialogue where those alerts will eventually appear. When an application is composed of various workspaces or dashboards , but a user has not added content to those areas, those pages or screens will be empty. Search results lists when nothing is found , as well as other cases where a command creates empty output. The default of an empty space is to simply remain empty: Display no content to the user until the space has been configured or personalized. While this approach may save development time (or even be an intentional decision during an early beta design of a product where other features must be initially prioritized), it ultimately creates confusion and decreases user confidence — and misses a goldmine of opportunities for increasing the usability and the learnability of the application, as well as the discoverability of key features. Empty states that are intentionally designed — not left as an afterthought — can be used to: Communicate system status to the user Help users discover unused features and increase learnability of the application Provide direct pathways for getting started with key tasks In This Article: Use Empty States to Communicate System Status Use Empty States to Provide Learning Cues Use Empty States to Provide Direct Pathways for Key Tasks Conclusion Use Empty States to Communicate System Status Totally empty states cause confusion about how and whether the system is working. When users encounter an empty panel or screen in an interface after attempting to filter, query or display specific content, they’re likely left wondering a myriad of questions: Is the system finished processing the request? Is content still loading? Did an error occur? Did I set the wrong filters or parameters? As an example, consider the dialogue for displaying log details below. When a user specifies and applies a date range for which there are no logs, the table in the dialogue — logically — does not display any log details. However, because there is no system feedback provided, the user cannot know whether there truly are no details to display, whether an error has occurred, or whether the system is still processing the request. Users are likely to waste time refreshing the query several times before feeling confident enough to move on. This dialogue lacks appropriate feedback: It is unclear whether there are no details to display in the table or the system is still working on gathering and displaying the details. A brief system message within the content area at completion of the process (e.g., “There are no records to display for the selected date range”) would be a simple yet effective way to increase the visibility of system status and, therefore, user confidence in the results. A simple message (There are no records to display for the selected date range) communicates the state of the system and increases user confidence. A worse, yet equally common scenario, especially in applications with high information density and lengthy processing times, is when the system defaults to a misleading system-status message: declaring that there are no items to display, only to replace it with content after the process is completed. For example, when loading content in the employee-management software below, users encounter an empty-state container with the system-status message No records . This information would be highly useful if, in fact, there were no records. However, after a few seconds of waiting, the system replaces the inaccurate system-status message with the requested items. Upon entering a new screen, users initially encounter an inaccurate system-status message No records (left). After several seconds, as the system finishes loading content, the message is replaced with a list of relevant items (right). Inaccurate system-status messages for empty states are particularly harmful. In the best-case scenario, users wait out the process and discover the relevant content but develop a severe distrust of and distaste for the application. In the worst-case scenario, trigger-happy users (that is, most users) never see the relevant content and cannot complete their work. Use Empty States to Provide Learning Cues In-context learning cues displayed when the user has started a task help users understand how to use an application or system in real time, as they explore the system. In most cases, this approach is generally more successful than forced tutorials shown to the user at initial use. That’s because in-context help can often be applied right away and is thus more memorable — users have little time to establish associations between lengthy onboarding content and the actual interface. Empty states present an opportunity to provide contextual help relevant to the user’s task. These help messages are sometimes called pull revelations because they show up only when the user interacts with the corresponding UI element and they are not “pushed” in any obtrusive or interruptive way. For example, consider the Alerts panel below from an enterprise resource-planning (ERP) application. When the Alerts panel is populated with alerts, it is fairly obvious how one might engage with the content. (This state of the panel is probably how this element was mocked up and tested.) However, when the Alerts panel is empty, it presents the issues previously discussed: Users may wonder whether an error has occurred or whether they have accurately created parameters necessary to trigger alerts. (As in the earlier example, a brief system-status message stating that there are no alerts would be useful here.) Furthermore, though, this totally empty state of the Alerts panel misses an opportunity to educate the user about the alerts function. A brief dialogue could provide information about what alerts are and how to get started using them. When there are active alerts (left), it is easy enough to understand how to dismiss and view details for alerts. When no alerts exist or have been created (right), the panel reverts to a totally empty state, missing an opportunity to provide contextual help to the user. In contrast, DataDog, a data-monitoring application, makes use of contextual help content within the empty state. When the user has not starred any items to create a list of favorites, the would-be content area displays the message Star your favorites to list them here . DataDog: When the users have not selected any favorites, the message Star your favorites to list them here , shown in the empty-state container, teaches users about the favoriting functionality and explains how the empty area could be used. In a similar example, when no items have been recently viewed in Microsoft Power BI, the empty-state screen contains a brief system message describing how content is added there. Microsoft Power BI: The empty-state container for inexistent recent items explains how content gets added to this area. Use Empty States to Provide Direct Pathways for Key Tasks In addition to alerting users of system status and increasing system learnability with pull revelations, empty states can also be used to provide direct pathways for getting users started with key tasks or completing steps related to their current workflow. For example, in one application-development software, the following system-status message No Records; Send a request to view details in the workspace was encountered in an empty state when no records were able to be displayed during a task. While this message does provide contextual information about what the user could do to view these records (i.e., it says to Send a request to view details in the workspace ), it doesn’t tell the user how to accomplish that task, or where to go in the system to find the necessary functionality. This system-status message within an empty state provides contextual help about what the user could do to view records, but it doesn’t tell the user how to accomplish the task. A better approach is to provide brief yet explicit instructions or, better yet, link directly to the steps that need to be taken to complete tasks associated with populating the empty state. (Here, the text Send a request might directly link to a message center or launch a message dialogue.) For example, the application below provides a direct link within the empty state — a button labeled Create which allows users to create alerts. For users who may need more information to understand why alerts are useful and how to use them, a Learn more link item also leads directly to associated documentation. The empty-state alerts panel links to additional relevant documentation and provides a button to begin creating alerts from directly within the empty state. This type of empty-state design has useful implications for users getting started with complex application features, as well. For example, when users have yet to add log data to their accounts within Loggly, a cloud-based log-management application, the empty state contains 2 direct pathways into the workflow: adding external log sources or populating demo data into the application to use for safe exploration. Loggly: An empty-state screen provides 2 direct pathways for getting started: adding log sources or exploring with demo data. Conclusion Don’t let empty-state design be an afterthought within your application. Intentionally designed empty states can help increase user confidence, improve system learnability, and help users get started with key tasks. To summarize a few main points: Do not default to totally empty states. This approach creates confusion for users, who may be left wondering if the system is still loading information or if errors have occurred. When content does not yet exist for a screen, page, or panel, use the empty state to provide help cues. Tell the user what could be displayed, and how to populate the area with that content. Provide direct pathways (i.e., links) to getting started with key tasks related to populating the empty state. When a process is running, use progress indicators to increase visibility of system status. If there is no relevant data to display after a process has completed, use the empty space to provide a system-status message in the empty space that briefly states that no content is available.

This progress indicator is used for full page loads and reduces the perception of a long loading time by providing clues for how the page will ultimately look. A skeleton screen is a design pattern used to indicate that a page is loading while providing users with a wireframe -like visual that mimics the layout of the page. This specific type of progress indicator is used exclusively for full-page loads. LinkedIn uses a skeleton screen to indicate that the page is loading and to give users a sense of how the page will be structured. In This Article: What Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens? Static-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens Animated Skeleton Screens Frame-Display Skeleton Screens Benefits of Using Skeleton Screens Are Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners? Conclusion References What Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens? There are 3 main types of skeleton screens: Static-content and -image skeleton screens Animated skeleton screens Frame-display skeleton screens Static-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens These are the most common skeleton screens and look like wireframes, in which the light gray boxes represent content and images. The structure of the gray boxes mimics the structure of the final page with content. The skeleton screen helps users build a mental model of what will be on the page and even gives some clues as to the underlying information hierarchy. Headspace uses a skeleton screen to build users’ expectations for the structure of the page. This skeleton screen relies on design conventions, with large gray boxes representing images and long rectangle boxes representing text. The thickest gray line at the top (1) implies a page title, with a smaller secondary line underneath that would be descriptive text (2); below that, the page is structured into a sequence map (3) with a card at each step. In each card there will be a title (4), a bit of accompanying text (5), and an image (6). On the right you can see what the fully loaded page actually looks like. Animated Skeleton Screens Some skeleton screens include animations in the form of a pulsating movement, with the use of gradients or elements fading in and out. These are similar to wait animations (or spinners) and signify that the system is still working and still loading content, decreasing users’ perception of a long loading time by keeping users engaged on the content being loaded. Note that animations of this sort can potentially be distracting , annoying, or even create accessibility problems for some users. DoorDash uses a short, animated skeleton screen in the form of a shimmer that moves from left to right. Frame-Display Skeleton Screens One variation that we do not recommend is a skeleton screen that displays only the frame of the application without a content wireframe. These minimal skeleton screens only include the header, footer, and the background. This style doesn’t include placeholders of the content, and as a result, doesn’t give users a sense of the general structure of the page. A frame display is not recommended because, if users are forced to wait for too long, they will assume the page isn’t working because the screen is mostly blank. NBC displays only the frame of the page, with a pulsing background gradient used to communicate that the page is loading. However, this skeleton screen is essentially equivalent to a spinner , since it doesn’t include any information about the page structure. Benefits of Using Skeleton Screens Skeleton screens help the user understand that the page is loading, while also communicating what the page will look like. Here are a few reasons why you might consider using skeleton screens: Prevent the user from thinking that the site isn’t working. When a user visits a site or an application and they come across a blank screen while the page is loading, they may assume something is wrong and leave. Skeleton screens help users focus on the content being loaded and give them something to look at while waiting. Create the illusion of a shorter wait time. Long loading times annoy users. Because a skeleton screen looks like a wireframe, it creates the illusion that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. The indication of progress gives users a sense that it won’t take a long time to load. Reduce users’ cognitive load . Instead of overwhelming users by showing them a blank page first and then immediately a full page of content, skeleton screens help users process what the page will look like and give them time to develop mental models of the page structure before they are bombarded with a lot of information at once. For example, when users see a big square with a little box under it, they will know to expect an image with a caption. Are Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners? Skeleton screens, progress bars, and spinners all show that the system is loading information, but they serve different purposes and work best in different situations. Here are a few guidelines to help you make the decision on when to use each design. Waiting-Period Lengths Matter Spinners or wait animations provide feedback to users that the system is working but don’t give any indication on how long users will have to wait; therefore, they are best used when the page takes 2–10 seconds to load. Similarly, skeleton screens should be used with a wait time that’s under 10 seconds. On the other hand, progress bars are strongly recommended for any page that takes longer that 10 seconds to load because they give users a sense of the state of the system and of how much longer they have to wait. Anything above 10 seconds requires an explicit estimation of duration. For waiting periods less than 10 seconds, both skeleton screens and spinners could work . How do you decide between the two? Spinners are typically best used on a single module, like a video or a card which is on a dashboard. Skeleton screens (with the exception of frame-display ones) are better when the full screen is loading because the wireframe gives users a sense of what the page will look like and, thus, minimizes cognitive load. No Skeleton Screens or Spinners for Quick Page Loads If a page takes less than 1 second to load, skeleton screens or spinners aren’t necessary, as they likely won’t make a difference to the users’ experience. Using a skeleton screen in such situations can be annoying because the quick flashing page can cause users to feel like they can’t keep up. Progress Bars Are Best for Process-Related Indicators Skeleton screens are used to indicate progress only when the process that the system is performing is a full-page load. Whenever some other process (e.g., download, upload, convert a file) is involved, it does not make sense (and could even be confusing) to show a skeleton screen. Instead, show a progress bar or a wizard that walks the user through the steps of the process. Do Not Use a Frame-Display Skeleton Screen Frame-display skeleton screens display no information about the page layout; they show only a header, footer, and an empty background. They should not be used as a progress indicator because they do not give users any sense that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. If users end up having to wait for a long time, they will assume the page is not working and abandon it. Conclusion Users generally get impatient by long loading periods. Skeleton screens ease the pain of waiting for medium-length durations by showing the page structure in a gradual manner, through placeholders and subtle animations. While skeleton screens are useful, they do not replace performance-optimization efforts. Skeleton screens are simply one extra tool for improving the wait users sometimes have to experience when content is loading. References Thomas Mejtoft, Arvid Långström, and Ulrik Söderström. 2018.

Over 30 years ago, Jakob Nielsen created 10 Usability Heuristics as general guidelines for designing digital products. These heuristics equally apply today as they did back then. Usability heuristic #9 emphasizes the importance of good error-message design: \"Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors.\" Effectively handling errors is crucial because it's one of the 5 quality components of usable experiences. Error message : A system-generated interruption to the user's workflow that informs the user of an incomplete, incompatible, or undesirable situation according to the system's implementation. Quality and error messages rarely go together, though. Product teams can be so focused on designing or engineering the idealistic user path that deviations from that path become a frustrating afterthought. In This Article: Visibility Guidelines Communication Guidelines Efficiency Guidelines Mitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations Conclusion Visibility Guidelines Error messages must present themselves noticeably and recognizably to users. Display the error message close to the error's source. Reduce cognitive load by displaying an error indicator adjacent to the interface where the error occurred. Proximity helps users associate the error message content with the interface elements needing attention. Bad: When the user adds an unrecognizable URL to their Instagram profile, the resulting error message is subtly styled and positioned far away from the URL field. Use noticeable, redundant, and accessible indicators. Text and highlights that are bold, high-contrast, and red are conventional error-message visuals. Use this styling for the message and for the affected elements needing correction. Another technique for improving noticeability is leveraging carefully designed animations to guide the user's visual attention for corrections. Remember accessibility guidelines to aid the roughly 350 million people worldwide with a color-vision deficiency, and never use exclusively color or animation to indicate errors. Good: Amazon utilizes several techniques to indicate an error: border highlighting, iconography, and red text. Good: CafePress displays an animated banner to attract the user’s attention to the blank customization field. Design errors based on their impact. Design your error messages to indicate the problem's severity. For example, sometimes users only need to be warned of unexpected or potentially undesirable outcomes but can otherwise advance their workflow. Differentiate between these \"good to know\" messages from those posing a barrier to the user's progress. For example, conditionally displayed labels, toast notifications, or banners can be used for issues needing minimal user interaction, whereas modal dialogs require the user's attention and resolution and should be reserved for severe errors. Good: Kohl’s uses a message without conventional red formatting to notify users about potential shipping delays. Avoid prematurely displaying errors. Timing is a crucial aspect of designing effective error messages. Presenting errors too early is a hostile pattern . It’s like grading a test before the student has had a chance to answer. It can make users feel annoyed, belittled, or confused. Don't assume that exploratory interactions (like the user moving text focus from a text box without filling it in) are errors. However, do consider inline, real-time errors for error-prone interactions where users are unlikely to enter the correct information on their first try. This immediate guidance reduces interaction costs for correction. Good: CLEAR provides clear, accessible indicators close to the text input about meeting specific password requirements, which could be a highly error-prone interaction. Bad: This Texas vehicle-registration–renewal page displays an error if the email text input loses focus while empty, which suggests the user did something wrong by merely exploring the interface. Communication Guidelines Error messages cannot rely on visuals alone. They must contain copy to elaborate and assist the user with recovering from the error. Use human-readable language. Error messages should be plainspoken using legible and readable text (many writing apps can give you feedback on a message's readability). Avoid technical jargon and use language familiar to your users instead. The Web's most common error message, the 404 page, violates this guideline. Hide or minimize the use of obscure error codes or abbreviations; show them for technical diagnostic purposes only. Concisely and precisely describe the issue. Generic messages such as An error occurred lack context. Provide descriptions of the exact problems to help users understand what happened. That said, beware of excessive technical precision and accuracy that can undermine understandability. The user's mental model of how the system works likely differs from the conceptual model of how it was coded. Bad: When searching for dining locations with very narrow filters, Disneyworld obfuscates the lack of results with puns instead of clearly conveying the situation. Offer constructive advice. Merely stating the problem is also not enough; offer some potential remedies. One example is an Out of stock message for an ecommerce website. Include details of when the product will be available again or suggest that users sign up for a restock notification by entering their emails. Take a positive tone and don't blame the user. Write with a positive and nonjudgmental tone of voice . Don't use phrasing that blames users or implies they are doing something wrong, such as invalid , illegal , or incorrect . The proper usage of any system lies with its creators and not with the system's users, so the system must gracefully adapt and not shift blame. Avoid humor since it can become stale if users encounter the error frequently. Good: Target gives clear feedback that users must spend more to qualify for same-day shipping. Note how the message avoids blaming the user for not purchasing enough and focuses instead on the threshold. Bad: The National Geographic Kids website does not explain itself if an underage user clicks on the shop. A better message would clarify that only adults can use the shop and that the user should ask for their help. Efficiency Guidelines Good errors go beyond just explaining but protect the user's effort and time. Offer accelerators to resolve the situation or share a bit of instruction to aid users' understanding and hopefully avoid the problem in the future. Safeguard against likely mistakes. The very worst error messages are those that don't exist. When users make a mistake and receive no feedback, it can create a cascade of misunderstanding, wasted effort, and frustration. Years ago, email apps would dutifully send your email even though it referred to an attachment you forgot to include. Now, most apps will detect this situation and prompt you with an error message before sending it, thus sparing you embarrassment. Good: Email apps have evolved to detect and warn about common email mistakes, such as forgetting to include attachments. Preserve the user's input. Let users correct errors by editing their original action instead of starting over. For example, display the original text entered into a text field even if it does not match the requirements for that field and allow the user to modify it. Good: If the user navigates back while adding an image to an Instagram story, the system provides an option to save their work as a draft to avoid losing it. Reduce error-correction effort. If possible, guess the correct action and let users pick it from a small list of fixes. For example, instead of just saying City and ZIP code don't match, let users click on a button for the city that matches the ZIP code they entered. Concisely educate on how the system works . Explain to your users how the system works and how to resolve an error. If additional information is required, use hypertext links to connect a concise error message to a page with supplementary material or an explanation of the problem. (Don't overdo this, though.) Good: Vistaprint communicates what will happen to text placed outside the printable area for a custom shirt. Bad: Although Zazzle displays guides for a shirt's printable area, it does not warn the user about the cut-off text, potentially resulting in designing and purchasing an undesired shirt. Mitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations The above guidelines are essential and applicable to all error messages. That said, there is one last guideline to consider when the system becomes incapable of serving users in any functional capacity: Mitigate total failure with novelty. Errors are unenjoyable for everyone involved as they interfere with user and business goals. Yet sometimes users may encounter an error so catastrophic (e.g., overloaded servers) there is no recourse but to wait or try again later. It's these specific moments (which should be rare and avoided at all costs) where blending an apology with something surprising or novel may salvage a disappointing situation that users will likely remember due to negativity bias and the peak-end rule . Don't underestimate the challenge of communicating humility and delight — especially if user input is in jeopardy or the context has severe implications for users. Yet this tactic might enhance memorability and sustain user interest with low-stakes experiences until the system resumes functioning. Good: Generative AI experiences like ChatGPT can use downtime to entertain and teach users about its open-ended capabilities until the service is restored. Good: Although Twitter stopped using the \"Fail Whale\" (by artist Yiying Lu) to notify users of service disruptions, the image transcended its error-message status and became famous for its whimsical depiction of effort. Conclusion Interactions between humans and computers are constantly evolving, but there will inevitably be mistakes, misunderstandings, and, thus, a need for error messages. Follow these guidelines to ease these frustrating moments and help the user accomplish their task efficiently and with renewed confidence.

Forms are necessary components of many applications and websites. They are used to log in, purchase items, send feedback, enter personal information, and more. When mistakes are made in forms, good error messages and thoughtful error flows can easily guide users to fixes. In This Article: Principles of Designing Error-Correction Flows 1. Aim for Inline Validation Whenever Possible 2. Indicate Successful Entry for Complex Fields 3. Keep Error Messages Next to Fields 4. Use Color to Differentiate Errors from Normal Field States 5. Add Iconography or Subtle Animation for Easy Scanning 6. Use Modals or Confirmation Dialogs Sparingly 7. Don’t Validate Fields Before Input is Complete 8. Don’t Use Validation Summaries as the Only Indication of an Error 9. Don’t Use Tooltips to Report Errors 10. Provide Extra Help for Repeated Errors Conclusion Principles of Designing Error-Correction Flows An error flow should allow users to easily fix their mistakes and proceed with their tasks. Effective error design makes sure that: Error messages are easily noticed and understood. The field(s) in error are easy to locate. Instructions for fixing errors are visible when the error is fixed. This article contains practical guidelines for designing error flows in forms. 1. Aim for Inline Validation Whenever Possible Ideally, all validation should be inline ; that is, as soon as the user has finished filling in a field, an indicator should appear nearby if the field contains an error. This approach reduces interaction cost for the user by allowing them to fix errors immediately, without searching or returning to a field they thought was completed correctly. Sometimes inline validation is not possible, and data entered by the user must be sent to a server for verification. In these cases, make sure error messages are clear, actionable, and easy to locate when the form or page is reloaded. 2. Indicate Successful Entry for Complex Fields Inline validation can also be used to indicate successful completion of fields. For example, when the user creates a username, a green checkmark and a message that the username is available provide clear feedback. For complex inputs such as new passwords, instant inline validation (which appears as the field value is being typed) will prevent users from guessing or checking multiple times if what they’ve entered meets the system's guidelines. In the example below, the password-strength indicator changes as the user types and helps the user decide if the string entered is good enough or if more characters need to be added. Slack indicated password rules and also provided instant validation by showing a password-strength meter as the user typed. However, don’t go overboard with success indicators. Success indicators shouldn’t distract users from filling out forms and should only be used when the additional context helps complete the form faster or more accurately. For example, you don’t need to show a success message when the only requirement on the field is that it is filled in, as that message won’t provide much additional context to your user. 3. Keep Error Messages Next to Fields With inline validation, error messages are naturally shown next to the field causing the error. But even when the fields are not validated inline, it’s helpful to show an actionable error message below or next to the problem field in order to help the user fix the error. The message should f ollow error-message guidelines : it should be explicit, human-readable, polite, precise, and give constructive advice. Keeping error messages next to the fields in error minimizes working-memory load: users can see the error message while fixing the error instead of having to remember it. 4. Use Color to Differentiate Errors from Normal Field States Red is the color most associated with errors, along with orange or yellow for warnings and green or blue for success. Make sure that the validation text stands out from the rest of the form so the user will notice it quickly. Add a semitransparent background of the same color to the error field to make it stand out on a long page with many form fields. 5. Add Iconography or Subtle Animation for Easy Scanning In addition to color, an icon to the left of your error message or validation summary will draw attention to the error and help users who are colorblind. When the user scans the form, the icon will stand out and draw the eye to what needs to be fixed. Adobe.com: The red color and the icon next to the error message drew users’ attention. A subtle pulse or bounce animation on the icon corresponding to an error can further draw users’ attention to the error. However, don’t abuse animation: several animated icons can be overwhelming if there are multiple errors. And don’t animate text — animated error messages are hard to read. 6. Use Modals or Confirmation Dialogs Sparingly When you need to draw extra attention to a potential error, use a modal or confirmation dialog to explain details and help the user fix the issue. However, use such dialogs sparingly as they have two big disadvantages: They are disruptive. The error message appears in a window that must be dismissed before fixing the error, forcing users to remember complex instructions and increasing cognitive load . Modal dialogs are, however, okay if the error message is simple or the form could still be submitted as it is. Gmail.com used a modal to warn the users that the attachment was missing. This error presentation is suitable because the error message is fairly simple, and the user can choose to proceed without including an attachment. 7. Don’t Validate Fields Before Input is Complete In most cases, avoid showing an error until the user has finished with the field and moved to the next field. It’s frustrating to see an error message before being given the opportunity to finish typing. When placing an order on BestBuy.com, an error message appeared in the Email Address field after the user navigated away from it. However, going back to fix the error prompted another error to appear in the Phone Number field, although the user had not started typing in that field. 8. Don’t Use Validation Summaries as the Only Indication of an Error A validation summary is shown at the top of a form and lets users know that there are errors that need to be fixed on the page, whether those errors are in the viewport or below the fold. A validation summary can give the user a global understanding of all the errors in a form but shouldn’t be used as the only form of error indication, as it forces the user to search for the field in error; moreover, the error message may no longer be present in the viewport when the user reaches the error field, thus forcing the user to memorize the error message while fixing the issue. SurveyMonkey provided error messages at the top of the form as well as below the specific field(s) causing errors. 9. Don’t Use Tooltips to Report Errors Tooltips are sometimes used to indicate errors, typically with an alert icon displayed next to the field(s) in error. When users hover over the icon or focus on the field, a tooltip or a toast containing the error message appears. This approach is generally not recommended for a few reasons: Alert icons are hard to notice , especially on visually dense interfaces. Users may not realize that an error message is displayed and wonder what is wrong with the field without realizing that they need to hover or focus to see the message. It adds unnecessary effort , requiring users to take extra steps to access critical information. Facebook.com: The errors in the signup form were displayed as alert icons. Users had to click on each one to see what the problem was. While in this example, the errors are easy to infer, it would be harder to do so if the fields were filled in. 10. Provide Extra Help for Repeated Errors When users encounter the same error repeatedly (3 or more times in a single form-filling attempt), it indicates a deeper issue in the user interface — unclear error messages, a mismatch between the design and users’ needs, or overly complex requirements in the form. Remember that when users make errors, it’s not their fault. Errors highlight flaws in your design. Quicken provided a link to a contact form to get in touch with support if repeated errors occur. To address repeated errors: Review analytics data for error patterns to identify common scenarios where errors occur. Test and refine the design to uncover the root cause of errors. Revise error messages to provide more actionable feedback. Conclusion Error flows should be designed to help users fix mistakes in a form and help them avoid making more. Ensure that users can easily detect errors, understand how to fix them, and see the error message while correcting the corresponding error. Remove the guesswork and let users get on with their tasks.

No one wants to commit an error — in life or while using an application or website. Making a mistake — while a natural part of life and often an opportunity for learning — can cause damage, result in tedious extra work, and just make people feel flustered or ashamed for not knowing exactly how to do something. It makes sense then that not one, but two of Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics are devoted to errors: Heuristic #5 is error prevention . This guideline states that we should prevent problems from occurring by eliminating error-prone conditions or by providing a confirmation option before users commit to actions with serious consequences. Heuristic #9 is help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors . Error messages should be expressed in plain language, communicate the problem and a solution, and make use of visual styling that will help users notice them. When designing digital experiences, prioritizing error prevention and recovery is a commendable and worthwhile strategy. But some well-meaning designs attempting to adhere to these heuristics take it too far, subjecting users to overly aggressive patterns that are frustrating and distracting rather than helpful. Overly aggressive patterns for error prevention and recovery can be avoided by following these 2 guidelines: Avoid premature error messages: Display error messages only after the error has been made. Reserve error styling for errors only: Limit use of error-like visual treatments (e.g., red text, caution and warning symbols) for critical system-status messages that are meant to disrupt the users’ workflow. This article provides examples and guidelines for avoiding these pitfalls. In This Article: #1: Avoid Premature Error Messages #2: Reserve Error Styling for Errors Only Conclusion #1: Avoid Premature Error Messages Premature error messages are error messages that are presented by the system too early — before the user has reached a fair and reasonable point in the workflow to have truly committed an error or not. Consider a user filling out a form — a common task on many websites and applications. Ideally, and when technical constraints allow, it’s best to inform users of any form errors in real time , as they are committed. But many form validation triggers are too impulsive, displaying error messages before the user has had a chance to finish filling in the field. One such case is when a system displays an error message before the user is finished typing a value in a form field with a predetermined, correct format. The error message is displayed as soon as the user begins typing, even when they have not veered off course from the predetermined format. (In other words, typing a “2” in a phone number field should not trigger an error message; whereas displaying an error message as soon as a letter is typed in the phone-number field would be appropriate.) For example, LG’s checkout process displays a premature error message as soon as the user begins typing numbers into the ZIP code field and maintains that error message until the number of characters reaches the predetermined format. While displaying the error message inline (beside the field it is related to) is useful, the error message itself is unwarranted: no mistake has been made. (Adding to the noise, a second, redundant message is also triggered and displayed at the bottom of the form.) LG’s website displays a premature error message about ZIP code format as soon as the user begins typing in the field. The error message persists until 5 characters have been typed. Labcorp (a medical-billing company) uses a similar pattern on its payment portal. As soon as a letter is typed into the email-address field, the error message Invalid email address immediately assaults the user. Labcorp’s payment portal displays the premature error message Invalid email address as soon as the user begins typing in the Email Address field. In another example, attempting to fill in birth date information during Sorel’s checkout process triggers the in-line message Please enter a valid date. Sorel.com: The premature error message Please enter a valid date is triggered before the user can finish entering the information in the birth date fields. As a general rule of thumb, avoid displaying the error until the user has finished with the field and moved to the next field. Displaying error messages while the user types feels like an unwarranted scolding and can be irritating. An even more frustrating variation of premature inline validation is the error message that appears before the user even begins typing. This type of error message is either triggered as soon as the user clicks into the field or, worse, appears in the default state of the form before any interaction takes place. In these cases, the user isn’t even given the chance to begin filling in the field before being admonished. During the reservation process for Hilton’s Conrad New York hotel, clicking into the field for Last name causes the field to be outlined in red and triggers the inline error message Please enter a last name below the field. These error indicators would useful if the user skipped that field and attempted to submit the form, but they should not be triggered by simply clicking into the field. (To make matters worse, all fields contain the word “optional” before the user interacts with them, even the Last name field displaying the inline error message.) Conradnewyork.com: The inline validation message Please enter a last name is displayed as soon as the user clicks into the field. In an even more aggressive approach , the Xpress-pay patient-payment portal below displays the error message Amount cannot be blank before the user even interacts with the field. What’s more, in addition to the error message, there are 3 additional redundant indicators that the Amount field is required: an asterisk by the field label, an icon with an exclamation mark in the far right of the field, and a bold, red outline around the form field itself. This Xpress-pay payment portal displays the in-line error message Amount cannot be blank before the user interacts with the field, along with an onslaught of redundant indicators for the required field (an asterisk, a warning icon, and a red border around the field). Of course, in any form, we recommend explicitly communicating which fields are required — but an asterisk is generally sufficient. Providing redundant or additional aggressively styled indicators that a field is required serves no end, and it feels combative. The inline, error message Amount cannot be blank would be useful if displayed after a user attempted to submit this form without filling in the required field. Displayed prematurely, it is overkill at best and annoying at worst. #2: Reserve Error Styling for Errors Only Another aggressive pattern is using error-like visual treatments in situations where errors have not actually occurred. One such case is styling noncritical system-status messages with visual treatments better suited for warnings and errors. Critical error messages and warnings should be intrusive. When errors display, the user is likely paying attention to the task at hand, not thinking about the error, so the error message should disrupt the work enough to gain the user’s attention. Therefore, intrusive styling for errors (e.g., red text or visual treatment, caution symbols, warning signs) makes sense. But routine system-status messages that communicate noncritical information should not be disruptive. They should be discoverable, but not intrusive. In the HR application below, the message There are no attachments to display is styled like a warning. The information seems more important than it really is, due to the yellow visual treatment and the caution symbol. Users who encounter this message will be disrupted, pausing to consider “ Should there be an attachment?” (Because uploading an attachment is optional in this case, the answer is: It doesn’t matter.) In this application, the noncritical information There are no attachments to display is styled like a warning (with a yellow background and caution symbol). Yellow coloring and caution icons (such as an exclamation mark in a triangle) are best reserved for warnings in situations where failure or significant change has occurred or is likely to occur, but where irrevocable damage has not or will not occur. For example, the Amazon Glow application appropriately uses a yellow caution icon to inform the user that a call has failed. Amazon Glow’s mobile application uses a yellow caution icon to indicate a failed call. In another example, during a checkout process for the online bookstore Thrift Books, clicking into any form field under Billing Address triggers the message Please ensure that your address is correct, it can’t be changed once your order is submitted . While this information is useful, the red visual treatment and caution symbol make it look like an error message. The user must pause and process the message, doublechecking that an error has not occurred, while there is nothing to fix. Furthermore, the message introduces the question: Why can’t the address be changed? (This violates the heuristic of error recovery.) Thriftbooks.com: In this checkout process, the red visual treatment and caution symbol make useful information feel like an error message and create the perception that the user has made a mistake. Useful information that is not error related, such as this, is better presented without error-like visual treatment. For example, in Paypal’s mobile application, similar information is styled without red font or background coloring and with an information icon in place of the warning icon. Paypal’s mobile application displays nonerror notifications with subtle gray background coloring and an information icon (a lowercase i in a circle). Conclusion These aggressive strategies for error prevention and recovery are akin to standing over the shoulder of a user and shouting “ YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG! ” during a workflow. They can be perceived as offensive and cause undo frustration. Bottom line: Let’s assist users, not admonish them. Follow these guidelines to effectively support error prevention and recovery without making users feel assaulted or shamed: Wait until a user moves on from a field to display an error message related to an appropriate format (e.g., ZIP code, email address). Provide any constraints upfront; do not wait until the user begins typing or attempts to submit the entry. Use an asterisk to mark required fields or annotate required fields with the word required . Do not overload the user with multiple indicators (e.g., asterisk and red outlined field and inline validation message). Display additional elements if and after the user attempts to submit a form or page without filling in required fields. Reserve error-like visual treatments (e.g., red text, caution, and warning symbols) for critical system-status messages that are meant to disrupt the users’ workflow.

In interaction design, a system, whether an application, website, or piece of hardware (anything from a smartwatch to a thermostat ), should always keep users informed , by providing appropriate feedback. Ensuring that the state of the system is always visible is one of the 10 usability heuristics for interface design . Information about system status, such as error messages and notifications of system activity, allows users to fully understand the current context. In This Article: Communicating System Status Indicators Validations Notifications Picking the Right Communication Option Is Important Conclusion Communicating System Status The best way to communicate system status varies depending on several key factors: The type of information being communicated The urgency of the information — how important it is that the user sees it immediately Whether the user needs to take action as a result of the information Three common approaches for status communication include validation, notifications, and status indicators. These terms are used sometimes interchangeably in product design, but they stand for different communication methods that should be used in different circumstances. Understanding the differences between them will help you sharpen your feedback to users by choosing the best option for each need. Indicators An indicator is a way of making a page element (be it content or part of the user interface) stand out to inform the user that there is something special about it that warrants the user’s attention. Often, the indicator will denote that there has been some change to the item represented by that element. Although, as we’ll see later, indicators are used quite frequently to signal validation errors or notifications, they can also be used on their own. Indicators are visual cues intended to attract users’ attention to a particular piece of content or UI element that is dynamic in nature. (If something always looks the same, it’s not an indicator, no matter how flamboyantly it’s designed.) There are at least three possible ways of implementing indicators: Oftentimes, but not always, indicators are implemented as icons . Easily recognizable icons can make very effective communication tools. Typographical variations can also be used as indicators; examples include the common convention of boldfacing unread email messages or color-coding stock symbols in an investment account if their price has changed substantially. Though less common, enlarged size or animation (e.g., vibration) can also be used to make certain items stand out from the crowd and thus serve as an indicator. Yelp used a red flame icon indicator in the search results to indicate that Paris Banh Mi is a Hot and New restaurant to try out. This indicator communicated additional information about Paris Banh Mi. Characteristics of indicators: Indicators are contextual . They are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content, and should be shown in close proximity to that element. Indicators are conditional — they are not always present, but appear or change depending on certain conditions. For example, a stock-performance indicator, such as the one in the American Century example below, may change to indicate if the stock price is increasing or decreasing. Additionally, the tag indicator in the Yelp example above only appears if there is a deal at that business. Indicators are passive . They do not require that a user take action, but are used as a communication tool to cue the user to something of note. American Century Investments used a conditional indicator to provide information regarding a specific stock’s performance. When the daily change was positive, the indicator was a green arrow pointing up. When the daily change was negative, it showed a red arrow pointing down. The condition of the stock performance impacted the indicator that was shown next to the price. Indicators can introduce noise and clutter to your overall interface, and may distract users, so it is important to consider how many (if any) indicators to use in your design. Consider the following when deciding if an indicator is appropriate: How important is the information to the user? Is it worth taking up space on the page to inform the user? How often is the information used? Would the user expect to see the information? Would it be missed if it weren’t provided? How important is it for the application that the user discovers the information? Validations Validation messages are error messages related to users’ inputs: they communicate whether the data just entered was incomplete or incorrect. For example, in e-commerce systems, validation messages often involve information such as name, billing address, and credit-card information. Cobragolf.com provided a validation message that clearly indicated which field was in error. Characteristics of validation: A user needs to take action to clear the validation message. The information in the validation message is contextual and applies to a specific user input that has a problem. The way in which validation should be implemented varies based on the unique needs of the form. However, in general, if the user’s input is incorrect, the system should inform the user by providing an identifiable and clear message that aids in correcting the error. Validation messages should follow the guidelines for error messages rather than simply identifying the problem, they should tell users how to fix it. For instance, don’t state “Field is blank.” Please enter your street address” is more polite and directs to a solution. Since validation is contextual, it can be helpful to use an icon indicator along with the validation message to help communicate which input(s) are missing or need corrected. Bestbuy.com provided a helpful validation message telling users how to fix the problem and also used an icon indicator and a different color to attract users’ attention to the field that needed correction. Notifications Notifications are informational messages that alert the user of general occurrences within a system . Unlike validation, notifications may not be directly tied to user input or even to the user’s current activity in the system, but they usually inform the user of a change in the system state or of an event that may be of interest. In the case of email, social networks, and mobile-phone applications, notifications can even be delivered while a user is away from the application. Notifications can be contextual —applying to a specific UI element— or global —applying to the system as a whole. Uniqlo used a contextual notification on their product detail page to bring attention to a tool that helps users find the right size. This notification does not require the user to take action to interact with the page. You could click the X button to close it, but it eventually disappeared after a period of inactivity. Characteristics of notifications: They are not triggered by users’ immediate actions. They announce an event that has some significance to the user. There are two main types of notifications, which differ based on whether the user is required to act upon the notification: Action-required notifications alert the user of an event that requires a user action. In this sense, they are similar to validation, but since they were not sparked by the user’s own action, they require a different design. Action-required notifications are often urgent and should be intrusive; for instance, they could be implemented as modal popups that interrupt the user, forcing immediate attention and requiring an action to be dismissed. The Mac operating system used a notification to inform users that an accessory device needed to be charged. The user could explicitly dismiss it from the screen, by opting to ignore or clicking anywhere outside of the notification. This is an intrusive notification that requires that the user take action. Passive notifications are informational; they report a system occurrence that does not require any user action. Many notifications in mobile apps are passive: they usually announce an event of potential interest to the user. Passive notifications are typically not urgent and should be less intrusive. A typical implementation of a passive notification may be a badge icon or a small nonmodal popover in a corner of a screen. Passive notifications can easily be missed, since they require no user action. When the information provided by the notification is key to the understanding of the system, an easy-to-ignore passive notification can be problematic. Adobe Creative Cloud used a nonintrusive passive notification to inform the user of an available application update. This notification appeared on screen for several seconds before disappearing. The user did not need to take any action on it. Visual Comfort and Co used a nonintrusive passive notification at the top of the product detail page to provide feedback that an item was added to the shopping cart. Such notifications sometimes cause issues for e-commerce shoppers who do not notice the message due to its location far away from the user's area of focus at the time (the add-to-cart button, which was further down the page). Users who miss the message may respond by adding an item to the cart multiple times or by disrupting their shopping flow to check the cart to see what items were added. No action was necessary to continue interacting with the page, yet it did persist if not dismissed. With its out-of-the-way placement on the page, persisting on the page was not intrusive to the user. On Mango.com when a user added an item to the cart, a notification appeared in a more intrusive way than Visual Comfort and Co. Taking over a portion of the screen reduces the risk that the user will not see the feedback. This notification was a bit of a hybrid between a passive and action-required notification. It was the direct result of a user action, so it's less important to require the user to take action to acknowledge it. Although it did have buttons to take action, if the user clicked anywhere or continued to interact with the page, the notification dismissed itself. Notifications have the design challenge that they are not always the immediate and obvious result of a specific user action. In some instances, the user may be in the middle of doing something different and may not be thinking about the issue raised by the notification. This requires notifications to establish more context and provide users with sufficient background information to understand what the notification is about. (In contrast, with a validation, the user has just done the thing that needs to be corrected. Thus, the validation message doesn’t need to educate users about the task at hand. For example, if an e-commerce checkout form has a field for a credit-card expiration date that was left blank, the validation message doesn’t need to say “Please provide the expiration date for the credit card you want to have charged $29.90 to pay for the blue sleeveless dress you are in the process of buying on Uniqlo.com.” However, a notification the following day that the dress has been shipped from the warehouse would need to say more than “Your package has shipped.” ) If a notification is contextual and relates to a specific element in the interface, an icon indicator on the element can communicate where that notification applies and catch the user’s attention. For instance, an indicator badge on a mobile-app icon shows that the user has received a notification from the corresponding app. The iPhone messaging app created a notification to communicate that a new message was received. Along with the notification, an indicator badge was placed on the messaging-app icon to communicate where the notification applied. To clear the indicator, the user had to view the message. Mint.com used an indicator together with a notification to communicate that an account needed attention. The warning indicator (1) appeared in close proximity to the summary of the account that needed attention, while the notification (2) appeared in the central area of the page with other important information. The actual text in the notification message could have been more helpful, though. Picking the Right Communication Option Is Important Using the wrong communication method can have a negative impact on the users’ experience. Let’s refer back to the scenario above where Yelp utilized a green-tag indicator in the search results to indicate that Tea Market had a special deal running. This information is contextual and important to users who have specifically searched for a place to have tea. You may think that an alternative way of alerting users of potential tea deals would be to send them a notification when such a deal has become available. Wrong! A notification sent irrespective of the current user goal would likely be ignored, and may even annoy users because it will disrupt their current task and be irrelevant to their current needs. (In general, any type of ad tends to be ignored unless it is related to the users’ aims and mindset .) Alternatively, a toast (a small nonmodal popup that disappears after a few seconds, like the New Stories one used by the Facebook app), while appropriate for passive notifications, would be a bad way to implement an error message, be it validation or otherwise. In fact, one of our mobile users spent 5 minutes waiting for some content to load only because she hadn’t notice the little error message presented at the bottom of the screen that quickly faded away after 5 seconds. Allmodern.com used an action-required notification to communicate that a product was saved as a favorite. For a user that is saving a lot of items to their favorites, this can be a bothersome and intrusive way of providing feedback. This may be better communicated by showing a passive nonmodal popover in the corner of the screen that can be seen, but doesn’t require the user to take action to clear it. Conclusion Remember the key differences between the three communication methods are: Indicators provide supplementary information about a dynamic piece of content or UI element. They are conditional —that is, they may appear or change under specific conditions. Validations are tied to a user’s action or input. Notifications are focused on system-related events. Understanding when and how to use each of these feedback tools is important in order to build consistency in the communication to users. By assessing the type of information delivered, we can determine the correct mechanism to use.

It can involve one or more of the following components: feature promotion, customization, and instructions. Imagine being dropped into a new job with no explanation of your primary work tasks or how to accomplish them. You probably wouldn’t be very successful (however that’s measured) or stay for very long, right? Having an effective onboarding process is key to enabling new employees to succeed. Further, each time a new process is introduced, onboarding would again be needed to get everyone to adopt it. The same is true for user interfaces, particularly when the interface is something intended to be used repeatedly. In this article, we’ll focus on mobile-app onboarding. We define onboarding as the process of getting users familiar with a new interface, using dedicated flows and UI elements that are not part of the regular app interface. This includes not only teaching users how to interact with the interface (a common misconception), but also completing any necessary setup. Additionally, onboarding is not limited to first-time users — existing users may also be onboarded when new features or redesigns are released. Thus, onboarding can occur at multiple points in a user’s lifecycle of an app, not just the first launch. In This Article: Skip Onboarding Whenever Possible When Does a Mobile App Need Onboarding? What’s Out There: Onboarding Components Feature Promotion Customization Instructions Conclusion Skip Onboarding Whenever Possible Generally speaking, onboarding is problematic for a few reasons: Higher interaction cost . Onboarding flows require user attention and effort. Even if users decide to skip your onboarding, they still have to click or tap to do so, thus increasing the interaction cost of completing a task in your application. Memory strain . Oftentimes onboarding is used to help users remember certain things about the interface (like what an icon means or how to do something), but human memory is limited. Instead of taxing user’s memory by asking them to remember several things about your app, build on existing mental models , and spend time making the app easier to use. May not improve user performance . We know some of the drawbacks of onboarding, but the benefits are sometimes less clear. However, our research on deck-of-cards tutorials, a method of instructional onboarding, showed that tutorials didn’t improve task performance . Consequently, we recommend professionals avoid creating app onboarding whenever possible and instead spend your resources making the UI more usable . When Does a Mobile App Need Onboarding? Users always need (often minimal) time to learn a new app, but that doesn’t mean that all apps require separate onboarding flows or lengthy explanations. For most mobile apps, users should be able to learn the interface by using it and thus instructional onboarding flows are not necessary . Even for fairly complex mobile apps, it’s often more effective to train users by showing them tips in context instead of presenting them with a tutorial that explains the app’s UI — people are simply unlikely to (even try to) remember a lot of information, especially if they are not sure whether they will actually have to use it. Also, while errors are a negative element of user experience, error messages can teach users a bit more about the app in a “teachable moment” where people have a small degree of motivation to read a few words about how to fix the problem. There are only a few situations when onboarding screens can be useful in a mobile app: You need user information to get started. For instance, a banking app may need users to create an account and confirm their identity before they use the app. The application functionality is highly tailored to the user’s context and preferences. For example, a dieting app will benefit from knowing the user’s current weight. Important app features or workflows are fairly unique to the app, and perhaps differ from standard UI patterns or are new and unfamiliar. For example, when mobile check deposit was first introduced as an alternative to in-person ATM deposits, that novel feature was worth a formal introduction. If you’re still unsure whether your app needs onboarding, test the app with no onboarding before investing money into adding extra screens. Do your users show difficulty using the app (or a new feature) for the first time? If yes, consider first whether you may be able to make some changes to the app design to make it more learnable. If that’s not possible, prototype an onboarding flow and test it. Does it solve your problems? Are people more successful at using the app? Only if the answer is yes, it is worth adding dedicated onboarding to your UI. What’s Out There: Onboarding Components There are three frequently encountered components in mobile onboarding flows: feature promotion, customization, and instructions. An onboarding flow may contain one or more of these components. There are three common components found in onboarding flows: feature promotion, customization, and instructions. An onboarding flow can contain one or more of these components. There are three common components found in onboarding flows: feature promotion, customization, and instructions. An onboarding flow can contain one or more of these components. In what follows, we look at each of these components in mobile apps and we discuss whether they are warranted. Feature Promotion Feature-based onboarding educates users about what the app can do, and, as such, tends to be perceived as marketing. Productive, a habit-tracker app, provided promotional onboarding that illustrated some of the things the app could do, like set reminders and view statistics. Avoid feature-promotion onboarding at first launch . Users rarely download an app for no reason; therefore, lengthy promotional onboarding will likely be skipped. The one exception to this rule is when a feature is truly new or advanced, such as the mobile-deposit example mentioned earlier. (Keep in mind though: that technology is no longer new, so today’s apps should not promote it at first launch! How quickly a feature progresses from novelty to well-known will vary, depending on how frequently it’s used and the memorability of its steps.) Instead of front-loading users with this information, present these types of promotional screens on the app store page, as that is where users will explore new apps and compare features. The Productive app also offered promotional content on its Apple app-store page under the Preview section. Including this content both on the app store and within the app is overkill. In addition to highlighting features on the app store, another solution is to highlight features while the user is in the app, through contextual help . For example, in the Productive app, it’s likely that users will want to see habit statistics only after there’s enough data. Instead of advertising this functionality before users have the means to do anything with it, highlight it when it’s actionable for them. For instance, after a user has logged 7 days’ worth of data around a habit, the app might provide a visual cue (like highlighting the statistics section of the app) and a short bit about what users can do with this data. Though this type of onboarding is less valid and helpful to a user at the app’s first launch, feature onboarding can be helpful to existing users when new features are released . For example, Chase used a deck-of-cards onboarding flow to introduce its new budgeting feature. The Chase banking app prompted existing users with a deck-of-cards feature onboarding flow to highlight new app functionalities (like a credit card spending summary). The flow was short and even allowed users to skip it altogether. Limit the usage of feature onboarding to what is truly new to users, not what’s been in your app for a while and has low utilization. Consistently highlighting existing features that your users may already be familiar with but aren’t relevant or needed by them can annoy people and make them ignore all such onboarding elements, even those for legitimately new features. Customization Many applications request user data so they can customize that user’s experience. For example, users might customize the content or visual design of an app. However, not all customization should be done during onboarding. In particular, visual-design customization, such as selecting a color scheme, doesn’t belong in onboarding. It’s hard for people to know how they will prefer the app to look before actually using it or why a certain visual design may be better than other. (Also, in general, a lot of research shows that people usually stick with defaults . Instead of making them choose and increasing the cognitive load, do your homework, run a study, and figure out which design is best.) The Reflectly app included visual-design customization in its onboarding. The app forced users to pick a color scheme before they knew how the UI would look. This is not to say you shouldn’t offer the functionality to customize a visual design, but you can save it for later. It does not deserve priority in your onboarding. Any.do allowed for visual-design customization via app settings and did not prompt users to select a theme on first launch. Content customization can create a relevant experience and is more likely to be appropriate for initial app onboarding. There are dozens of examples of content customization in apps. For example, for a language-learning app, picking a language and identifying how proficient you are in that language will be essential in order for the app to be useful. Fitplan greeted new users with a brief survey in order to tailor the app experience with recommended workouts. The app also provided a brief explanation of what information it needed and why. Additionally, though this survey was automatically presented, an option to Skip it was available, along with a progress indicator . When prompting users to customize their experience, keep it brief. Explain why you want that data and how it will be used (as in the Fitplan example above). Consider whether you truly need this information for a user to get started and be successful in the app. If you can’t explain why gathering that data is beneficial at launch, this information should be gathered later, once the user can better understand why it’s necessary. Instructions The goal of instructional onboarding is to teach users how to use an interface. Instructional onboarding should not be used to supplement poor design. Resources are better spent for making a UI more usable than for creating instructional content. That said, there are cases where instructions are warranted (for example, the features or workflows are unique to the app, different from standard UI patterns, or legitimately new and unfamiliar to users) or expected (mobile gaming). Instructional onboarding comes in many forms: deck-of-cards tutorials, contextual help, interactive walkthroughs, and so on. No matter the form, instructional onboarding should be brief, optional, and should only highlight the minimum that users need to know to use the app. The following are examples of instructional-onboarding styles in mobile applications. Decks of Cards Deck-of-cards tutorials usually are presented immediately when the app is launched and provide instructions for how to use its interface in a deck-of-card format (similar to a carousel). This type of onboarding, particularly in relatively simple mobile apps, tends to make the interface appear more complicated than it actually is, and strains user’s memory . Therefore, we don’t recommend deck-of-cards onboarding . That said, if you still choose to implement them, be kind to your users and ensure there’s a highly visible Skip option, minimize the number of cards to only focus on need-to-know information, and focus on one concept per card. What the Forecast?!! used a deck-of-cards tutorial to provide instructional onboarding and inform users where certain controls could be located in the app. Explanations of standard icons are useless and simply waste users’ time. Instructional Overlays Instructional overlays and coach marks are another type of instructional onboarding, used to show users where some core functionalities are located within the UI and what those elements do. When implementing instructional overlays, ensure the content is timely (like at a user’s first encounter with a feature) and unobtrusive. This type of onboarding pairs well when it accompanies a user trying to complete a task for the first time, and as such, provides extra nuggets of information as the user progresses. For this reason, instructional overlays are often nice-to-have and not need-to-have elements. The NOAA Weather app overloaded users by highlighting every possible interaction on one screen. This implementation was highly obtrusive and unnecessary for standard UI elements (like the Share and Settings icons). Checklist used instructional overlays to show users some core functionalities, like how to categorize and tag a packing list. However, the instructional copy is used to explain unfamiliar verbiage (left: in this case, a ‘category’ when discussing a packing list) and an unlabeled icon (right: the large orange tag). In this case, a less obtrusive solution for instructional content would be a popup tip so that, if a user needed clarity, it would be a tap away. (Even better: improve the UI instead of providing clarity on a bad one). Interactive Walkthroughs If your app is more complex than some of the previous examples, and you believe instructions are warranted because the design is new or unfamiliar, consider an interactive walkthrough. Interactive walkthroughs enable users to learn by doing (ideally in a low-stakes environment) . When done successfully, (i.e., brief and only highlighting what’s new or unfamiliar, as mentioned above) interactive walkthroughs feel more like a practice round and less like a tutorial. Fabulous, a goal-tracking app, used interactive walkthroughs to get users familiar with relatively easy and familiar workflows. This implementation was unnecessary. Temple Run 2 provided an interactive walkthrough where users were given timely on-screen instructions while playing a simple level of the game. For example, before an obstacle approached, instructions on how to avoid the obstacle were presented. This walkthrough taught users the game controls and gave them an opportunity to practice multiple times in context. MindNode, a mind mapping and brainstorming app, used an interactive walkthrough to get users onboarded to a less familiar workflow. In the tutorial, users created a very simple mind mapping artifact, and thus became familiar with the controls and terminology in an interactive, practice environment. An option to skip the tutorial was also present. Most mobile apps don’t need instructional onboarding. If you do include it in your app, save it for what’s novel (i.e. the elements and interactions that make your app different from similar apps) and make it short. Conclusion Keep onboarding as simple as possible. For most mobile apps, this means putting users directly into the interface. On the other hand, complex apps with unique interaction patterns or those that want user information to tailor the experience may benefit from onboarding flows. With onboarding, focus on what users need to be successful in your app, highlight what’s new or unfamiliar, and keep instructional content brief and unobtrusive.

Contextual help signals can avoid these pitfalls but require unintrusive ways to activate. In This Article: Examples of Tutorials in Apps Tutorials: Disruptive, Often Skipped, and Easily Forgotten Why Tutorials (and Push Revelations) Don’t Work What Works: Pull Revelations Guidelines for Implementing Pull Revelations Examples of Tutorials in Apps I recently purchased a bike that has an unusual feature –- instead of the classic chain drive system, it features a carbon-fiber belt that, doesn’t require messy grease, is nearly silent, and won’t rust in the rain. But, because it’s a fairly novel system for a bike, I had no idea how to properly set it up. Luckily, there was an app to help with that task, and it centers around a fairly unique interaction: you pluck the carbon-fiber belt on the bike as if it were a guitar string, and the app measures the sound’s frequency with the microphone in your mobile device to tell you whether the belt is properly tensioned. Neat! When I first launched the app, it ushered me into a long tutorial on how to set up the new belt. The multistep tutorial was nice and clear, except for one big thing –- once I finished it, I couldn’t remember how to do the procedure on the setup screen, and, even worse, I couldn’t figure out how to launch the tutorial again. Eventually, I realized that there was a list of instructions available in the Help menu, but that still required me to memorize the steps, go back to the main part of the app, and complete the process with all that information in my working memory . Gates Carbon Drive app: After the tutorial finished, it dropped the user into the app without any further guidance. The user had to remember the steps and actions presented in the tutorial to set up the belt. Consider another recent experience. I was trying to dispute a fraudulent credit-card charge in my bank’s mobile app. I was, as you might imagine, a bit stressed. As I logged into the app, hoping to get things resolved quickly, I was bombarded with this walkthrough: Chase bank’s mobile app showed a deck-of-cards meant to promote new features when the user logged in. Not only did this walkthrough interrupt the user from their task, but it did not communicate what the specific improvements were or how to use them. Now, I’m happy for the Chase UX team that it’s made improvements. However, I was not filled with a sense of excitement and wonder when I encountered this tutorial. Nor was I motivated to go and explore these changes; I had a task to complete, and it was fairly pressing. This tutorial added to my stress during a moment when I relied on my bank to provide ease and stability. In that context, the happy and excited tone of the messaging came across as rather tone-deaf –– it also slowed me down , which is something that we don’t often want to do to our users. Or, consider another variation of this common experience. Imagine you’re on a tight deadline to finish a project at work. You log in to the productivity application you use everyday and are bombarded by a list of changes in a What’s New release-notes modal . You dismiss it without bothering to read it, trying to get to your work. You then realize that many of the tools and features you rely on have been moved around, but you can’t find that list of changes anywhere to guide you Tutorials: Disruptive, Often Skipped, and Easily Forgotten Good help and documentation are critical, especially with fairly complex or nonstandard interactions. And, in fact, this is one of the 10 usability heuristics . But not all help is created equal. Intrusive tutorials and lists of changes that are shown when an app is launched or at random points during the user’s session are a type of push revelation. Push revelations reveal new information out of context, without any specific indication that the user would benefit from the information at that moment . A good user experience depends heavily on context –- presenting information and options to users at the right moment, when they are ready for it, not when it’s convenient for the system. Push revelations are well-named: they are typically pushy , devoid of context, and intrusive. These sorts of tutorials tend to get used in two ways: for new user onboarding and to make existing users aware of new features or changes. Both struggle with similar problems: they interrupt users who are attempting to do something else at that moment, they don’t tend to be memorable, and they also don’t result in better task performance . So, in essence, they slow users down, get in the way, and don’t achieve their very reason for being. Now, this isn’t to say that walkthrough-style tutorials are never appropriate (our own research indicated that they were useful for onboarding new users to a novel interaction paradigm like AR ), but they are dramatically overused. Moreover, we find that users frequently skip them. ArcGIS included a detailed interactive onboarding tutorial that was better than many other tutorials or walkthroughs. Unlike many other walkthroughs, this one required users to perform the task, rather than simply showing them how to do it. Furthermore, this tutorial wasn’t activated automatically the first time the user logged in but rather was made available in the sidebar. This design made it possible for users to revisit the tutorial later, when they inevitably forgot much of the information. Tutorials seem like they should be effective for helping users learn: they’re directly telling users how to use the software! And yet, in our studies, they frequently don’t perform well with real users. So, what goes wrong? Is the whole idea of a tutorial bad, or is the execution that’s flawed? Are there ways to make them work better? First, let’s break down what’s wrong. Why Tutorials (and Push Revelations) Don’t Work These are the main design mistakes that tutorials (and, more generally, push revelations) make: Users want to start using the product right away. They don’t want to spend time studying how to use your app.. This is known as the paradox of the active user (a paradox because the prep work would benefit them in the long run). The interruption posed by a tutorial is unwanted, so users skip it. The guidance that tutorials provide, while potentially helpful, is hard to remember when the user needs it . The tutorial shows information out of context, and users would have to memorize it to use it when applicable. Unfortunately, our memory is quite limited. Tutorials could increase the likelihood that users retain the information by forcing them to practice using the feature. However, that can be annoying for those users who turned to the product to complete a different task. Dismissing the tutorial or the push revelation requires user effort. For example, push revelations (even if not full-blown tutorials) are often designed to be visually salient and noticeable, which unfortunately also makes them more likely to be distracting or annoying. What Works: Pull Revelations It turns out that we can solve these issues by presenting help content contextually . Pull revelations are help content triggered by some signal that the user would benefit from that information at that moment. Pull revelations can come in a variety of formats ranging from hover tooltips or coach marks to more expansive patterns like step-by-step task-flow wizards. Figma uses a pull revelation to note a change to its default text rendering: the tip is shown only when the user is involved in an activity related to the tip (e.g., they have added a new text box). Guidelines for Implementing Pull Revelations Pull revelations require that the app knows the what the user is trying to do and thus, they can be trickier to implement than push revelations. Determining the user’s goal is relatively straightforward in some situations — for example, if the user hovers over a new toolbar icon, it’s appropriate to show them a tooltip or an instructional overlay. However, for more complex work, things can go wrong. The famous Clippy, the Microsoft Office assistant, was a failed attempt to develop AI-driven pull revelations; the failure was due to the intrusive and didactic nature of the revelations, the annoying animated, hard-to-ignore character sitting in the user’s peripheral vision, and the relatively unsophisticated, often wrong pattern matching used to figure out what the user was attempting to do. Some guidelines for appropriately using contextual help include: Make it easy to dismiss (and recall) the help content . Being able to get rid of a (momentarily) unhelpful overlay is absolutely critical, but so is the ability to find this information again later, when it is actually useful. Evernote shows a list of new features in the sidebar that can easily be dismissed. However, the What’s New list at the bottom left remains in place in case the user wishes to access it again. Use progressive disclosure in the help content. Make the existence of the contextual help visible, but do not overwhelm the user with detail until they ask for it. Photoshop: A pull revelation is used to help users expand their command vocabulary. The tooltip appears when a user hovers over a toolbar icon and features a simple animation demonstrating the effect of the tool — useful for new users who need to quickly develop an understanding of the various features. The tip also uses progressive disclosure ( Learn how ) to engage those users who want more information on how to use the tool, but not overwhelm all users with unnecessary detail. No memorization! For multistep workflows, make sure that the help content doesn’t require the user to keep lots of information in their working memory — show help content alongside each step to minimize cognitive load . Skip the obvious stuff. If your app follows design conventions, you probably don’t need to give users lots of detail on what the gear icon means (it usually means Settings ). Save the contextual help for more complex functionality or processes. Understand the user’s journey to that feature. Take the time to really consider when the user is most likely to interact with the feature in question. This is the most important guideline, but also the most complex. This requires user research and task analysis to figure out how users actually interact with your product and what sorts of signals indicate that a user is in need of help.

Why? At Baymard we’ve tracked the global average cart abandonment rate for 14 years, and it currently sits at 70.19%. After e-commerce sites have invested vast resources in “first in mind” strategies, Pay Per Click campaigns, beautifully crafted homepage imagery, faceted search logic, etc., it seems almost unbearable that 70% of users – after having added items to their cart – then choose to abandon their purchase. Why is it that this many orders are abandoned? And what exactly can online retailers do to improve this sad state of affairs? That’s exactly what we wanted to find out. At Baymard Institute, we started researching checkout usability more than 14 years ago when we founded the institute and did our first round of large-scale checkout usability testing. Ever since, we’ve tested and re-tested checkout usability, running large-scale qualitative research studies testing the checkout flows of the world’s leading e-commerce sites, as well as conducting checkout UX audits for more than 150 leading e-commerce sites. During all 14 years of usability testing we have consistently found the design and flow of the checkout to frequently be the sole cause for users abandoning their purchase during the checkout flow. Either because users become so infuriated that they leave in anger, or because they don’t know how to complete one or more fields, and thus have no other option but to leave. This page provides you an overview of the results from those years of testing checkout flows with real end-users. All of this research is available as part of Baymard Premium . The Current Checkout UX Performance To accompany the checkout usability test sessions we’ve also benchmarked the checkout flows of 327 top-grossing US and EU e-commerce sites across our 110+ Cart &amp; Checkout guidelines, each on a 7-point weighted scale. This has resulted in a benchmark database with 30,000+ checkout elements manually reviewed and scored, along with 26,000+ best and worst practice examples from leading e-commerce sites (all categorized and performance verified). The UX performance scores from our most recent Cart &amp; Checkout UX benchmark update are plotted in the interactive scatterplot above. When looking at the general state of Cart &amp; Checkout usability, 65% of sites have a performance of “mediocre” or worse, 35% of sites feature a “decent” or better checkout flow, and only 2% are “good”. What’s more, none were able to reach a “perfect” or “state-of-the-art” experience. Thus there is great room for improvement. The average site has 32 unique improvements to perform in their checkout flow, to gain the 35% increase in conversion rate our combined usability test sessions show that the average large-scale e-commerce site can potentially improve through better Checkout UX. However, the nuances and diversities behind the overall mediocre performance are manyfold. This is a subset of the full benchmark which includes 327 e-commerce sites.

It was a pleasure collaborating with the Baymard team. ” Aaron Henig Operations Manager at Epicenter Consulting, New York “ Within a very short time Baymard Institute provided 15 clear, useful improvement suggestions for our checkout process. We intend to implement all of them. It’s easy to find companies that offer website improvement suggestions. But, most companies don’t do their homework and don’t provide specific examples of how best to make the improvements. With Baymard Institute, the checkout process suggestions they made were intuitive, specific, and actionable. I highly recommend their audit service. ” Chris Hall President of RepairClinic.com “ This UX audit has been very helpful, not just for our design and product teams, but even for the UX research team, because we can reference back to the audit, either in the design of a user research session or when we analyze findings.

WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. A different page introduces WCAG 3 . WCAG is not an introduction to accessibility.

The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. Who WCAG is for WCAG is for those who want a technical standard. It is not an introduction to accessibility. For links to introductory material, see “Where should I start?” in the FAQ . WCAG is primarily intended for: Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.) Web authoring tool developers Web accessibility evaluation tool developers Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility To meet the needs of others — including policy makers, managers, and researchers — there are many different WAI Resources . What is in WCAG 2 The WCAG 2.2 has 13 guidelines. The guidelines are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust . For each guideline, there are testable success criteria . The success criteria are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA . The success criteria are what determine “conformance” to WCAG. That is, in order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria. Details are in the Conformance section of WCAG . For a short summary of the WCAG 2 guidelines, see WCAG 2 at a Glance . Supporting material and supplemental guidance The following resources help you understand and implement WCAG, and improve accessibility beyond WCAG: Quick Reference / How to Meet WCAG 2 / Checklist Understanding WCAG 2 Techniques for WCAG 2 Test Rules for WCAG 2 Supplemental Guidance Please read about these WCAG 2 resources from WCAG 2 Documents . WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards are referenceable when they are published as a ‘W3C Recommendation’ web standard. WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018, and updates were published on 21 September 2023, 12 December 2024, and 6 May 2025. WCAG 2.2 was published on 5 October 2023, and an update was published on 12 December 2024. For information on the updates, see the WCAG 2 FAQ . WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 are designed to be “backwards compatible”, which means content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. If you want to meet all the versions, you can use the WCAG 2.2 resources and you don’t need to bother looking at earlier versions. All the success criteria from 2.0 are included in 2.1, and all from 2.1 are in 2.2 (except 4.1.1, explained in the next paragraph). WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines. WCAG 2.1 adds 1 guideline and 17 success criteria. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1 . WCAG 2.2 adds 9 success criteria. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.2 . A few things have changed, and we intend the updates in the related documents to support backwards compatibility in practice. The main change is that in WCAG 2.2, one success criteria (4.1.1 Parsing) is obsolete. Notes added to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0 errata address this, as explained in WCAG 2 FAQ, 4.1.1 Parsing . WCAG 2.2 also includes Notes about different languages; more information is in WCAG 2 FAQ, internationalization . WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.2 are all existing standards. WCAG 2.2 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the latest version of WCAG. Translations Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of WCAG 2 are listed in WCAG 2 Translations . ISO/IEC 40500, EAA, EN 301 549 WCAG 2.2 is an approved International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2025 , and is available free from ISO. ISO/IEC 40500:2025 is exactly the same as the October 2023 version of WCAG 2.2. We expect the December 2024 version of WCAG 2.2 to be available as ISO/IEC 40500:2026 by late 2026. In addressing the European Accessibility Act (EAA), most organizations use WCAG and the European Standard EN 301 549: Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services. EN 301 549 currently uses WCAG 2.1. We expect the next version of EN 301 549 to use the latest version of WCAG 2.2. To find how laws around the world use WCAG, see Web Accessibility Laws &amp; Policies . W3C encourages you to use the latest version of WCAG. Content that meets WCAG 2.2 also meets WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. Who develops WCAG The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ( AG WG ) (formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group) , which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) Web Accessibility Initiative ( WAI ). WAI updates Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 periodically. We welcome comments and submission of new techniques . Opportunities for contributing to WCAG and other WAI work are introduced in Participating in WAI .

Abstract Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on any kind of device (including desktops, laptops, kiosks, and mobile devices). Following these guidelines will also often make web content more usable to users in general. WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material. WCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [ WCAG20 ], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating web accessibility policies. Status of This Document This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C standards and drafts index at https://www.w3.org/TR/. This is a Recommendation of WCAG 2.1 by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group . This incorporates errata and are described in the change log . At some point additional changes might be incorporated into an Edited or Amended Recommendation . To comment, file an issue in the W3C WCAG GitHub repository . Although the proposed success criteria in this document reference issues tracking discussion, the Working Group requests that public comments be filed as new issues, one issue per discrete comment. It is free to create a GitHub account to file issues. If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, send email to public-agwg-comments@w3.org ( comment archive ). This document was published by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group as a Recommendation using the Recommendation track . W3C recommends the wide deployment of this specification as a standard for the Web. A W3C Recommendation is a specification that, after extensive consensus-building, is endorsed by W3C and its Members, and has commitments from Working Group members to royalty-free licensing for implementations.

Background on WCAG 2 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general. WCAG 2.1 is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG 2.0 [ WCAG20 ], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [ WAI-WEBCONTENT ] and is designed to apply broadly to different web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview . Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more . Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of web development and interaction work together, see: Essential Components of Web Accessibility User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview Where this document refers to WCAG 2 it is intended to mean any and all versions of WCAG that start with 2. WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall principles , general guidelines , testable success criteria and a rich collection of sufficient techniques , advisory techniques , and documented common failures with examples, resource links and code. Principles - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust . See also Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility . Guidelines - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques. Success Criteria - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.1 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in Understanding Levels of Conformance . Sufficient and Advisory Techniques - For each of the guidelines and success criteria in the WCAG 2.1 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of techniques . The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are sufficient for meeting the success criteria and those that are advisory . The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.1 . All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users. Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive language and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. Metadata may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs. WCAG 2.1 Supporting Documents The WCAG 2.1 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.1 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include: How to Meet WCAG 2.1 - A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.1 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating web content. This includes content from WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 and can be filtered in many ways to help authors focus on relevant content. Understanding WCAG 2.1 - A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.1. There is a short \"Understanding\" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.1 as well as key topics. Techniques for WCAG 2.1 - A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests. The WCAG Documents - A diagram and description of how the technical documents are related and linked. See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for a description of the WCAG 2.1 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of websites, and accessibility policies are listed in WAI Resources . Requirements for WCAG 2.1 WCAG 2.1 meets a set of requirements for WCAG 2.1 which, in turn, inherit requirements from WCAG 2.0. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.1. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2. Comparison with WCAG 2.0 WCAG 2.1 was initiated with the goal to improve accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.1 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines. WCAG 2.1 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.1 without losing conformance with WCAG 2.0. Authors following both sets of guidelines should be aware of the following differences: New Features in WCAG 2.1 WCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, guidelines to organize the additions, and a couple additions to the conformance section. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, thereby meeting conformance obligations that are specific to WCAG 2.0. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.1 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention WCAG 2.0, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes. The following Success Criteria are new in WCAG 2.1: 1.3.4 Orientation (AA) 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA) 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA) 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA) 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA) 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A) 2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA) 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA) 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A) 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A) 2.5.3 Label in Name (A) 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A) 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA) 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA) 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA) The new success criteria may reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria. In the Conformance section, a third note about page variants has been added to Full Pages , and an option for machine-readable metadata added to Optional Components of a Conformance Claim . Numbering in WCAG 2.1 In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2.0 is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.1 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2.0, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference provides ways to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options. Conformance to WCAG 2.1 WCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0 with a couple additions, which is described in the Conformance section. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines In parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed. 1. Perceivable Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives Understanding Text Alternatives | How to Meet Text Alternatives Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content Understanding Non-text Content | How to Meet Non-text Content (Level A) All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

Test If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. Sensory If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. CAPTCHA If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities. Decoration, Formatting, Invisible If non-text content is pure decoration , is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology .

Success Criterion 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) Understanding Audio-only (Live) | How to Meet Audio-only (Live) (Level AAA) An alternative for time-based media that presents equivalent information for live audio-only content is provided. Guideline 1.3 Adaptable Understanding Adaptable | How to Meet Adaptable Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships Understanding Info and Relationships | How to Meet Info and Relationships (Level A) Information, structure , and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. Success Criterion 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence Understanding Meaningful Sequence | How to Meet Meaningful Sequence (Level A) When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined . Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics Understanding Sensory Characteristics | How to Meet Sensory Characteristics (Level A) Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. Note For requirements related to color, refer to Guideline 1.4 . Success Criterion 1.3.4 Orientation Understanding Orientation | How to Meet Orientation (Level AA) Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential . Note Examples where a particular display orientation may be essential are a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television, or virtual reality content where content is not necessarily restricted to landscape or portrait display orientation. Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose Understanding Identify Input Purpose | How to Meet Identify Input Purpose (Level AA) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when: The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for user interface components section ; and The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data. Success Criterion 1.3.6 Identify Purpose Understanding Identify Purpose | How to Meet Identify Purpose (Level AAA) In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of user interface components , icons, and regions can be programmatically determined . Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable Understanding Distinguishable | How to Meet Distinguishable Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color Understanding Use of Color | How to Meet Use of Color (Level A) Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Note This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in Guideline 1.3 including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding. Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control Understanding Audio Control | How to Meet Audio Control (Level A) If any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. Note Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference . Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) Understanding Contrast (Minimum) | How to Meet Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA) The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: Large Text Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1; Incidental Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component , that are pure decoration , that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement. Logotypes Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement. Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text Understanding Resize Text | How to Meet Resize Text (Level AA) Except for captions and images of text , text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality. Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text Understanding Images of Text | How to Meet Images of Text (Level AA) If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following: Customizable The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements; Essential A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. Note Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

Logotypes Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement. Success Criterion 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio Understanding Low or No Background Audio | How to Meet Low or No Background Audio (Level AAA) For prerecorded audio-only content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio CAPTCHA or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true: No Background The audio does not contain background sounds. Turn Off The background sounds can be turned off. 20 dB The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds. Note Per the definition of \"decibel,\" background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content. Success Criterion 1.4.8 Visual Presentation Understanding Visual Presentation | How to Meet Visual Presentation (Level AAA) For the visual presentation of blocks of text , a mechanism is available to achieve the following: Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user. Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK). Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window . Success Criterion 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) Understanding Images of Text (No Exception) | How to Meet Images of Text (No Exception) (Level AAA) Images of text are only used for pure decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. Note Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential. Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow Understanding Reflow | How to Meet Reflow (Level AA) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels ; Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels . Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. Note 1 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom. Note 2 Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content. Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast Understanding Non-text Contrast | How to Meet Non-text Contrast (Level AA) The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s): User Interface Components Visual information required to identify user interface components and states , except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author; Graphical Objects Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed. Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing Understanding Text Spacing | How to Meet Text Spacing (Level AA) In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties , no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property: Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size. Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script. Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus Understanding Content on Hover or Focus | How to Meet Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA) Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true: Dismissible A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid. Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author. Note 1 Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML title attribute . Note 2 Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion. 2. Operable User interface components and navigation must be operable. Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible Understanding Keyboard Accessible | How to Meet Keyboard Accessible Make all functionality available from a keyboard. Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard Understanding Keyboard | How to Meet Keyboard (Level A) All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. Note 1 This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not. Note 2 This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation. Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap Understanding No Keyboard Trap | How to Meet No Keyboard Trap (Level A) If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface , then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. Note Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference . Success Criterion 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) Understanding Keyboard (No Exception) | How to Meet Keyboard (No Exception) (Level AAA) All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts Understanding Character Key Shortcuts | How to Meet Character Key Shortcuts (Level A) If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus. Guideline 2.2 Enough Time Understanding Enough Time | How to Meet Enough Time Provide users enough time to read and use content. Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable Understanding Timing Adjustable | How to Meet Timing Adjustable (Level A) For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: Turn off The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or Adjust The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or Extend The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, \"press the space bar\"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or Real-time Exception The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or Essential Exception The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or 20 Hour Exception The time limit is longer than 20 hours. Note This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with Success Criterion 3.2.1 , which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action. Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide Understanding Pause, Stop, Hide | How to Meet Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A) For moving, blinking , scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true: Moving, blinking, scrolling For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause , stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential ; and Auto-updating For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential. Note 1 For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to Guideline 2.3 . Note 2 Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference . Note 3 Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so. Note 4 An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken. Success Criterion 2.2.3 No Timing Understanding No Timing | How to Meet No Timing (Level AAA) Timing is not an essential part of the event or activity presented by the content, except for non-interactive synchronized media and real-time events . Success Criterion 2.2.4 Interruptions Understanding Interruptions | How to Meet Interruptions (Level AAA) Interruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency . Success Criterion 2.2.5 Re-authenticating Understanding Re-authenticating | How to Meet Re-authenticating (Level AAA) When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating. Success Criterion 2.2.6 Timeouts Understanding Timeouts | How to Meet Timeouts (Level AAA) Users are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions. Note Privacy regulations may require explicit user consent before user identification has been authenticated and before user data is preserved. In cases where the user is a minor, explicit consent may not be solicited in most jurisdictions, countries or regions. Consultation with privacy professionals and legal counsel is advised when considering data preservation as an approach to satisfy this success criterion. Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions Understanding Seizures and Physical Reactions | How to Meet Seizures and Physical Reactions Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions. Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold Understanding Three Flashes or Below Threshold | How to Meet Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A) Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds . Note Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference . Success Criterion 2.3.2 Three Flashes Understanding Three Flashes | How to Meet Three Flashes (Level AAA) Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period. Success Criterion 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions Understanding Animation from Interactions | How to Meet Animation from Interactions (Level AAA) Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed. Guideline 2.4 Navigable Understanding Navigable | How to Meet Navigable Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks Understanding Bypass Blocks | How to Meet Bypass Blocks (Level A) A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages . Success Criterion 2.4.2 Page Titled Understanding Page Titled | How to Meet Page Titled (Level A) Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order Understanding Focus Order | How to Meet Focus Order (Level A) If a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) Understanding Link Purpose (In Context) | How to Meet Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A) The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context , except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general . Success Criterion 2.4.5 Multiple Ways Understanding Multiple Ways | How to Meet Multiple Ways (Level AA) More than one way is available to locate a web page within a set of web pages except where the web page is the result of, or a step in, a process . Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels Understanding Headings and Labels | How to Meet Headings and Labels (Level AA) Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible Understanding Focus Visible | How to Meet Focus Visible (Level AA) Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible. Success Criterion 2.4.8 Location Understanding Location | How to Meet Location (Level AAA) Information about the user's location within a set of web pages is available. Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) Understanding Link Purpose (Link Only) | How to Meet Link Purpose (Link Only) (Level AAA) A mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general . Success Criterion 2.4.10 Section Headings Understanding Section Headings | How to Meet Section Headings (Level AAA) Section headings are used to organize the content. Note 1 \"Heading\" is used in its general sense and includes titles and other ways to add a heading to different types of content. Note 2 This success criterion covers sections within writing, not user interface components . User interface components are covered under Success Criterion 4.1.2 . Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities Understanding Input Modalities | How to Meet Input Modalities [New] Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard. Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures Understanding Pointer Gestures | How to Meet Pointer Gestures (Level A) All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential . Note This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology). Success Criterion 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation Understanding Pointer Cancellation | How to Meet Pointer Cancellation (Level A) For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer , at least one of the following is true: No Down-Event The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function; Abort or Undo Completion of the function is on the up-event , and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion; Up Reversal The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event; Essential Completing the function on the down-event is essential .
